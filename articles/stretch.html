<p>The web is built on HyperText Markup Language (HTML), <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">proposed in 1990</a>
as a way to solve an inherent problem with vast bodies of writing: referencing
and creating links to other content.</p>
<p>The technology on HyperText has come a long way. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
was <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html">proposed in 1994</a> bringing versatility to layout and visual aspects of
HyperText documents; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/https://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html">in 1995 JavaScript came along</a> to enable dynamic
documents and complex behavior.</p>
<p>It didn&#x27;t take two decades before these technologies would grow nearly
limitless. Tools like <a href="https://d3js.org">D3</a> showcase the flexibility of the definition of what
a &quot;document&quot; is, using HyperText blocks with styling and behavior to enable
amazingly complex data visualization.</p>
<p>Yet most medium-to-long-form writing (like this one) is still mostly confined to
print media presentation and structure, except for the occasional embedded audio
or video. This seemingly staleness is not due to the lack of creativity. The
person who coined the term &quot;hypertext&quot; had already <a href="https://xanadu.com/XUarchive/htn8.tif">proposed StretchText in
1967</a>.</p>
<p>StretchText is an interesting and immediately appealing idea: text that can be
expanded into more details if and only if the reader has interest on it.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110305060430/https://www.telescopictext.org/text/KPx0nlXlKTciC">It</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130810011821/https://github.com/cantino/expando">keeps</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408235800/http://stretchtext.tiddlyspot.com/">getting</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220817154515/https://ncase.me/nutshell/">rediscovered</a>, though never making
it into wide adoption. Most people never heard of it and those who did have a
hard time recalling it being used in more than 3 places.</p>
<p>Why is that? Such an intriguing and powerful idea with so little traction. There
ought to be some reason to it. After <a href="/articles/life">writing some myself</a> and reading it
many times over, I think I can extrapolate from my own experience and the
reasons why I&#x27;m probably not going to use it much more either.</p>
<h2>Increased effort</h2>
<p>When using stretchtext one doesn&#x27;t have to concern themselves with the task of
reducing the overall scope to target a specific audience, as each level of
interest and expertise will self guide - in theory - to the appropriate level of
detail.</p>
<p>In practice, that means writing for multiple possible audiences at the same time
and planning ahead how to weave those two (three, four...) texts into a single
current of ideas. Instead of deciding whether to add a foot note (don&#x27;t!), a
separate paragraph, or link to a separate document; there&#x27;s now another set of
choices to be made at every turn.</p>
<p>Doesn&#x27;t sound too hard, but stretching words into expanded forms within parent
sentences requires writing similar to poetry. If stretching whole sentences to
more sentences, there&#x27;s still some effort in keeping harmony with the paragraph.
This level of orchestration isn&#x27;t expected from other forms of linked content
and highly increases the rewriting and rewording loop.</p>
<h2>Marginal gains</h2>
<p>Even if a reader is already optimally served by the current level of detail,
they will expand deeper <em>just to be sure</em>. The reader cannot tell what is their
ideal level of detail until they shoot past it, as there&#x27;s usually no means of
previewing the collapsed content. Going further, it&#x27;s likely that most readers
will expand the vast majority of collapsed content simply out of curiosity (or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a>) anyway.</p>
<p>Readers that would read the whole text can run out of patience for clicking and
re-reading; and readers that would have benefited from the terser form will
repeatedly experience the regret of unnecessary expansions before they learn to
live with the anxiety of not knowing what&#x27;s behind the curtain.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s probably why many platforms offer preview popovers on mouse hover instead
of stretchable embedded content: tooltip panes are cheap and ephemeral. The
reader doesn&#x27;t feel pressured to read or follow up content just because it
popped up. We&#x27;re used to dismissing popups. Popovers provide clearly demarcated
context switching and the reader expects the current document to be
self-contained on its purpose without them.</p>
<h2>Unnatural flow</h2>
<p>Reading documents with StretchText is hard both on its final render form and on
its source code form because natural language can be described with hierarchy
but we&#x27;re bad at processing anything other than small and heavily skewed trees -
very close to simple linked lists - and StretchText (much like excessive use of
parenthesis, passive voice and order inversions of subordinate sentences or
sentences that are too long with too many flow interruptions) introduces highly
balanced and hierarchically complex structures, leaving the reader with a train
of though nearly impossible to track and make sense in one go.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s bad writing because it yields uncomfortable reading. StretchText ins&#x27;t
cause nor cure for bad writing, but because it&#x27;s so hard to use well it will
most often get in the way.</p>
<h1>Future as Fringe Tech</h1>
<p>Given the big costs and difficulty of positive returns, the application of
StretchText is probably destined to remain rare. Its alternatives like
hyperlinks and conceptual successors like hovering commentary tooltips will
remain the preferred choices for tucking away additional content.</p>
<p>It also remains true that StretchText is <em>enticing</em>. It&#x27;s more interactive,
exercises curiosity, it&#x27;s <em>different</em>. Because it&#x27;s so difficult to get it
right, when it clicks it&#x27;s amazing. Used sparingly, intentionally and with a
great deal of sense of art, it will keep getting rediscovered now and then as an
exotic spice for hypertext. Arcane magic theorized before the web itself, a will
of the ancients.</p></div><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-85efd10cfa69e1d2.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/bce60fc1-5dbc0e295fd1bc4d.js" async=""></script><script
