<p>The web is built on HyperText Markup Language (HTML), <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">proposed in 1990</a>
as a way to solve an inherent problem with vast bodies of writing: referencing
and creating links to other content.</p>
<p>The technology on HyperText has come a long way. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
was <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html">proposed in 1994</a> bringing versatility to layout and visual aspects of
HyperText documents; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/https://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html">in 1995 JavaScript came along</a> to enable dynamic
documents and complex behavior.</p>
<p>It didn&#x27;t take two decades before these technologies would grow nearly
limitless. Tools like <a href="https://d3js.org">D3</a> showcase the flexibility of the definition of what
a &quot;document&quot; is, using HyperText blocks with styling and behavior to enable
amazingly complex data visualization.</p>
<p>Yet most medium-to-long-form writing (like this one) is still mostly confined to
print media presentation and structure, except for the occasional embedded audio
or video. This seemingly staleness is not due to the lack of creativity. The
person who coined the term &quot;hypertext&quot; had already <a href="https://xanadu.com/XUarchive/htn8.tif">proposed StretchText in
1967</a>.</p>
<p>StretchText is an interesting appealing idea: text that can be expanded into
more details if and only if the reader has interest on it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110305060430/https://www.telescopictext.org/text/KPx0nlXlKTciC">It</a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130810011821/https://github.com/cantino/expando">keeps</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408235800/http://stretchtext.tiddlyspot.com/">getting</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220817154515/https://ncase.me/nutshell/">rediscovered</a>, though never making it into
wide adoption. Most people never heard of it and those who did have a hard time
recalling it being used in more than 3 places.</p>
<p>Why is that? Such an appealing and powerful idea with so little traction. There
ought to be some reason to it. After <a href="/articles/life">trying to use it myself</a>, I think I
can extrapolate from my own reasoning as to why I&#x27;m probably not going to write
much more stretchtext either.</p>
<h2>Increased effort</h2>
<p>When using stretchtext one doesn&#x27;t have to concern themselves with the task of
reducing the overall scope to target a specific audience, as each level of
interest and expertise will self guide - in theory - to the appropriate level of
detail.</p>
<p>In practice, that means writing for multiple possible audiences at the same time
and planning ahead how to weave those two (three, four...) texts into a single
current of ideas. Instead of deciding whether to add a foot note (don&#x27;t!), a
separate paragraph, or link to a separate document; there&#x27;s now another set of
choices to be made at every turn.</p>
<p>Doesn&#x27;t sound too hard, but stretching words into expanded forms within parent
sentences requires writing similar to poetry. If stretching whole sentences to
more sentences, there&#x27;s still some effort in keeping harmony with the paragraph.
This level of orchestration isn&#x27;t expected from other forms of linked content
and highly increases the rewriting and rewording loop.</p>
<p>Poetry is lovely, but it&#x27;s also hard to write well at the same time an argument
has to be made or an opinion is to be shared. It requires a lot of effort and
it&#x27;s most often not contributing to the main goal of the writeup.</p>
<h2>Marginal gains</h2>
<p>Even if a reader is optimally served by a given level of detail, they will
expand <em>just to be sure</em>. The reader cannot tell what is their ideal level of
detail until they shoot past it, as there&#x27;s usually no means of previewing the
collapsed content. Going further, it&#x27;s likely that most readers will expand the
vast majority of collapsed content simply out of curiosity (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a>) anyway.</p>
<p>Readers that would read the whole text can run out of patience for clicking and
re-reading sentences to make sense of the influx; and readers that would have
benefited from the terser form will repeatedly experience the regret of
unnecessary expansions before they learn to live with the anxiety of not knowing
what&#x27;s behind the curtain.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s probably why many platforms offer page previews on mouse hover instead of
stretchable embedded content: preview is cheap and ephemeral. The reader doesn&#x27;t
feel pressured to read or follow a link just because they hovered over it.
Navigating to a different document is a clear context switch and the reader
expects the current document to be self-contained.</p>
<h1>Future as Fringe Technique</h1>
<p>Given the big costs and possibly negative returns, StretchText is probably going
to remain rare.</p></div><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-0ca402751deca59e.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/bce60fc1-5dbc0e295fd1bc4d.js" async=""></script><script
