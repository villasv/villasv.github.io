A wider or narrower opening changes the amount (and direction diversity) of light that comes through during the time the shutter is open.
Apertures are usually described by an f-number: the ratio of the system&amp;rsquo;s Focal Length to the diameter of the aperture. This means that a f/4 aperture is bigger than a f/8 aperture, in fact twice as big in diameter.</description></item><item><title>Aphorism</title><link>https://victor.villas/systematist/aphorism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/systematist/aphorism/</guid><description>An aphorism is a concise, terse, laconic, or memorable expression of a general truth or principle.

Regular coffee are usually blends because the beans used aren&amp;rsquo;t really high grade and are not thoroughly tracked. Specialty Coffee blends on the other hand are an art form on their own.
A good blend recipe has to combine multiple beans in a complementary way, achieving a flavor combination that no Single Origin Beans coffee could.</description></item><item><title>Bellroy Tech Kit</title><link>https://victor.villas/technophile/bellroy-tech-kit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/technophile/bellroy-tech-kit/</guid><description>https://bellroy.com/products/tech-kit/looma_viroblock_standard/basalt#slide-0

Pretty simply, it describes how much of the stuff in the cup is &amp;ldquo;not water&amp;rdquo;.
Strength is directly quantified by the concentration of coffee extract present in the solution. A very diluted coffee is &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; or watery, while a highly concentrated coffee is said to be &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo;. This concentration can be measured with a digital refractometer and is usually defined by the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) since soluble solids in the Coffee Extract are the main responsible for the flavor.</description></item><item><title>Brewing Control Chart</title><link>https://victor.villas/barista/brewing-control-chart/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/barista/brewing-control-chart/</guid><description>The brewing control chart represents brewed coffee flavor profiles as regions on a chart of Brew Strength and Extraction Yield.
The chart is divided into nine regions based on specified lower and upper limits for each variable. The vertical axis corresponds to Brew Strength measured in total dissolved solids (TDS) and Extraction Yield measured in mass concentration of dissolved coffee solids. These two specifications overlap to produce a box in the centre of the chart that indicates the most desirable cup of filter coffee.</description></item><item><title>Built-In Waste Bins</title><link>https://victor.villas/decorator/builtin-waste-bins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/decorator/builtin-waste-bins/</guid><description>SORT &amp;amp; GO BUILT-IN BIN by Brabantia https://www.brabantia.com/uk/sort-go-built-in-bin-2-x-16-litre-jade-green-grey/</description></item><item><title>Camera App Configurations For Photography</title><link>https://victor.villas/photographer/camera-app-configurations-for-photography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/photographer/camera-app-configurations-for-photography/</guid><description>These settings are based on the Halide app, but most apps have similar options available.

This means that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t control the amount of light entering the camera, but how the camera should interpret the light coming in.
A higher ISO means higher sensitivity, therefore a brighter image for the same amount of light captured. It&amp;rsquo;s useful to raise the ISO when there&amp;rsquo;s no other way to increase brightness (e.g. a slower shutter would add blur and wider aperture would decrease depth of field).</description></item><item><title>Chaves</title><link>https://victor.villas/genealogist/chaves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/genealogist/chaves/</guid><description>História e Brasão Sobre a história e o brasão da família Chaves é um pouco mais difícil de encontrar informações, um dos motivos sendo a confusão com o ainda existente município de Chaves em Portugal.

Considerando que a etimologia do nome da cidade de Chaves tem mais a ver com a dinastia romana Flavius e que em latim referencia uma cor de cabelo amarelo-durado-marrom[7], utilizar objetos chaves (mesmo que na cor dourada) é um acidente linguístico.</description></item><item><title>Choosing a Running Shoe</title><link>https://victor.villas/athlete/choosing-a-running-shoe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/athlete/choosing-a-running-shoe/</guid><description>Five big factors to consider:

Trail-running shoes have bigger lugs to grip on unstable terrain, stronger underfoot and generally stiffer to handle uneven surfaces.

There are two main plant species of coffee used for consumption: Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Canephora (Coffea canephora). The Canephora species has a most famous varieties named Robusta, commonly used as metonym for the species. Robusta is also known as Conilon in Brazil.
The Canephora species is considered to be an ancestor to the Arabica species, but there&amp;rsquo;s also evidence that the better flavor from Arabica were inherited from the Eugenioides species (Coffea eugenioides).</description></item><item><title>Coffee Extract</title><link>https://victor.villas/barista/coffee-extract/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/barista/coffee-extract/</guid><description>Roasted coffee is made up of some soluble solids and mostly insoluble solids (mainly cellulose) as well as volatiles that are liberated as gases. The composition depends on the species and variety of the Coffee Beans, the Coffee Fruit Processing, the Roasting and Extraction Methods used.
The soluble solids that are dissolved contribute the most to the brew taste and strength. The volatile soluble compounds contribute to its aroma. Caffeine in particular is among the most soluble components of ground coffee and is extracted early in the process.</description></item><item><title>Coffee Fruit Processing</title><link>https://victor.villas/barista/coffee-fruit-processing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/barista/coffee-fruit-processing/</guid><description>The coffee fruit/cherry can be subdivided in:
The seed Bean (endosperm) Silver Skin (spermoderm) Parchment (endocarp) Pulp (mesocarp) Skin (exocarp) The term processing in specialty coffee refers to the methods and preparation used to turn fresh ripe coffee cherries into green beans (which will go through Roasting next). This includes removing the bean from the fruit/cherry (depulping), fermenting and drying the beans. This can be done in several different styles, the 3 most basic methods being Natural, Washing and Honey processing and they have a big impact on the final flavor of the coffee.</description></item><item><title>Combine Comfort With Effort</title><link>https://victor.villas/socializer/combine-comfort-with-effort/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/socializer/combine-comfort-with-effort/</guid><description>Because Corresponding Affection Can Be Hard, it&amp;rsquo;s important to guarantee that an attempt will be made. In this case, one way to segue into an affection demonstration with a decreased risk of last-minute second thoughts is to plan ahead an easy start.
For example, for someone that finds hard to initiate with verbal affirmation or physical intimacy, waking up early and making breakfast will get things in motion. The other person will initiate a &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; or a hug that to be corresponded.</description></item><item><title>Corresponding Affection Can Be Hard</title><link>https://victor.villas/socializer/corresponding-affection-can-be-hard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/socializer/corresponding-affection-can-be-hard/</guid><description>Each person might be attuned to demonstrate affection in different ways. For example: verbal affirmation, being present, physical intimacy, gifting, proactive help, respecting space.
Most people will have a few preferred channels to demonstrate affection, which may or may not be their most attuned channel to perceive affection from others. Some people might even be fluent in all of them.
Whatever the case, it can be hard to correspond a demonstration of affection in the same manner if it comes through a channel that is a bit underdeveloped on the receiving side.</description></item><item><title>Create Your Own Website</title><link>https://victor.villas/internetizen/create-your-own-website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/internetizen/create-your-own-website/</guid><description>Deploying a website into your domain is the foundation for your presence on the Web.

It&amp;rsquo;s an industry practice that can be done informally by anyone or with strict protocols and guidelines by professionals.

It is determined by the Focal Length and the Aperture diameter.
For landscape photos, the depth of field has to be huge (kilometers). For portrait photos, the depth of field might be just a few centimeters.

In photography, the focal point stays at a small distance from the camera sensors called focal length.
A longer focal length means that light rays coming from objects far away will converge way before reaching the sensors, so they will disperse and the object will appear more blurry. Conversely, light rays coming from objects very near the camera will tend to converge further behind the sensors and will appear more blurry as well.</description></item><item><title>Focal Length Equivalence</title><link>https://victor.villas/photographer/focal-length-equivalence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/photographer/focal-length-equivalence/</guid><description>#TODO</description></item><item><title>Focus</title><link>https://victor.villas/photographer/focus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/photographer/focus/</guid><description>An object is said to be focused when its image appears &amp;ldquo;sharp&amp;rdquo;, meaning its edges are clearly defined.
To adjust an image focus is to determine the placement of objects in relation to the Depth of Field.

All wine grapes comes from a single species (vitis vinifera) and - compared to other grapes - they are smaller, sweeter, have thicker skins and contain seeds.
There are over 1,300 wine grape varieties used in commercial production, the top 100 of these varieties making up 75% of the world&amp;rsquo;s vineyards. Cabernet Sauvignon is the most planted variety, but other popular examples are Merlot, Tempranillo, Airén, Chardonnay, Syrah, Grenache Noir, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir.</description></item><item><title>Grinding</title><link>https://victor.villas/barista/grinding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/barista/grinding/</guid><description>In the grinding of coffee, the particle size distribution is the main concern. Finer particles will be more subject to extraction than bigger particles because they have more surface area per volume.

Total uniformity is not an absolute goal, however, because some diversity of sizes can be useful: having a bit of fines (a nickname for particles much smaller than the bulk of the distribution, usually smaller than $100 \mu m$ and consisting of mostly of bean skin, i.</description></item><item><title>Halide</title><link>https://victor.villas/photographer/halide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/photographer/halide/</guid><description>Auto Focus Mode In automatic Focus mode, it&amp;rsquo;s still possible to tweak the focus by tapping on the viewfinder.

The toasty, nutty or roasted flavors only develop from roasting where sugars from coffee are caramelized;

Each of the Grape Varieties exhibits these compounds at different levels and many facets explain wine’s unique flavor: acidity, sweetness, alcohol, tannin, and aroma compounds produced in fermentation.
Aroma: Some wines smell like berries, and others smell like flowers. Another contributing factor to wine’s aromas is aging. Nearly all red wines are aged in oak, which contributes an oak barrel’s flavor compounds (like vanillan) and acts as a conduit to expose the wine to oxygen.</description></item><item><title>TBD Title - Assume Nothing</title><link>https://victor.villas/systematist/tbd-title--assume-nothing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/systematist/tbd-title--assume-nothing/</guid><description>#TODO</description></item><item><title>TBD Title - Be Serious when Surprised</title><link>https://victor.villas/socializer/tbd-title--be-serious-when-surprised/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/socializer/tbd-title--be-serious-when-surprised/</guid><description>#TODO 😊 Serious when surprised Não rir, levar mais a sério / Risível = ridículo</description></item><item><title>TCA</title><link>https://victor.villas/sommelier/tca/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/sommelier/tca/</guid><description>Develops from mold in the corks.</description></item><item><title>The ENCODE Framework</title><link>https://victor.villas/systematist/the-encode-framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/systematist/the-encode-framework/</guid><description>A framework for note-taking used in Personal Knowledge Database systems.
