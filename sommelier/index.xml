All wine grapes comes from a single species (vitis vinifera) and - compared to other grapes - they are smaller, sweeter, have thicker skins and contain seeds.
There are over 1,300 wine grape varieties used in commercial production, the top 100 of these varieties making up 75% of the world&amp;rsquo;s vineyards. Cabernet Sauvignon is the most planted variety, but other popular examples are Merlot, Tempranillo, Air√©n, Chardonnay, Syrah, Grenache Noir, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir.</description></item><item><title>isoamyl acetate</title><link>https://victor.villas/sommelier/isoamyl-acetate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/sommelier/isoamyl-acetate/</guid><description>Vinegar, bananas.

It‚Äôs common to see these wines labeled by the name of that grape variety. For example, a bottle of Riesling is made with Riesling grapes. It‚Äôs useful to note that each country has different rules for how much of the variety should be included to be labeled as a varietal wine.</description></item><item><title>Tasting</title><link>https://victor.villas/sommelier/tasting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/sommelier/tasting/</guid><description>Within the tiny minutia of wine (the phenols, esters, higher alcohols, acids, etc.), you‚Äôll find the complexities of the wine‚Äôs flavors and aroma. Each of the Grape Varieties exhibits these compounds at different levels and many facets explain wine‚Äôs unique flavor: acidity, sweetness, alcohol, tannin, and aroma compounds produced in fermentation.
Aroma:¬†Some wines smell like berries, and others smell like flowers. Another contributing factor to wine‚Äôs aromas is aging. Nearly all red wines are aged in oak, which contributes an oak barrel‚Äôs flavor compounds (like vanillan) and acts as a conduit to expose the wine to oxygen.</description></item><item><title>TCA</title><link>https://victor.villas/sommelier/tca/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/sommelier/tca/</guid><description>Develops from mold in the corks.</description></item><item><title>vanillin</title><link>https://victor.villas/sommelier/vanillin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/sommelier/vanillin/</guid><description>Vanilla, oak.

Hence, the output of a vineyard can be identified by its year. When you see a vintage year listed on the label, that‚Äôs the year the grapes were picked and made into wine.</description></item><item><title>Whiskey Lactone</title><link>https://victor.villas/sommelier/whiskey-lactone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/sommelier/whiskey-lactone/</guid><description>Coconut, bourbon whiskey.

Most wine blends are mixed after the fermentation (and aging) is complete. When grapes are blended and fermented together it is called a field blend. A famous example of a field blend is¬†Port Wine.</description></item></channel></rss>
