            <description><![CDATA[<p>Fifth day in Brazil.</p><p>Being an expat is ever stranger. I do feel home. The birds, the food, smiles, slangs, the plants, flowers, sand. The car I used to drive. Muscle memory kicks in. It all feels like it should. Even the clouds look as if they had been broken and are now fixed.</p><p>But I also feel like a visitor. The heat, the traffic, inequality. It’s the same as always, but also worse than it was. It’s strange to so easily overhear, to invisibly connect so fast.</p>]]></description>

So immersive in its rendering of all that could be otherwise, the world of imagination and dreams and nightmares. So provocative in its resonance of the myriad lives of all peoples, all struggles and passions, laughter and cries. A book to feast upon as many times as I can afford in this life - it is said it&#x27;s a different book every time you come back to it, and I&#x27;m already wondering what&#x27;s it going to taste like next time.<br></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.</p><p>—<br><a href="https://neodb.social/book/2MDiC3Qu6SPYpzk82Glbaa" rel="nofollow">Invisible Cities</a> </p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>finished reading <a href="https://neodb.social/~neodb~/book/77foTxelPVvkedcPcgl1ZM" rel="nofollow">Playing Possum</a> 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗  <br>As a non biologist, this book was a super interesting listen for the compilation of studies regarding animal behavior and the respective anthropomorphism/anthropectomy we tend to color them. This is the rare non-fiction book that does NOT draw the reader towards The One Book mindset - where a concept is overstretched until it becomes a hammer capable of nailing all screws known to humankind.</p><p>I think the structural design of the book works well. As expected from a philosopher, the thesis is built from the ground up and a lot of effort is put into what these concepts are _not_ saying. I like it, but I can imagine that readers not used to the extra precision and nitpicking common to philosophy writers will find it a bit dry or dense at times.</p><p>The one small gripe I have is that after all this effort, the final chapter ends up playing like a shortcut. The case for animals having a concept of death brought by the distinction between tonic immobility and thanatosis (faking death, aka playing possum) and what this tells us about predators is mostly not dependant on the framework the book invests in building. It&#x27;s such a strong case, it feels like the core issue is answered by reading the first two or three chapters plus the last one, and everything in between is superfluous - but even the filler was very interesting to me, so it was time well spent anyway.<br></p>]]></description>

Also, what a shit touch to portray the therapist with totally useless interjections. Someone in this film crew doesn&#x27;t seem to believe this to be a real profession.</p><p>The plot tries too hard. I was willing to accept the selective effects of the aging vs growing with the unnecessary addition of high speed scarring, along the mysterious blockade that impedes people from leaving. That&#x27;s a bit too out there already in terms of bio sci fi, but workable as a premise. But it gets murkier on the details, like the specifics of some deaths.</p><p>And apparently this multi-billion dollar company and its scientists are smart enough to develop a cure for epilepsy but cannot find a way to plug a coral reef. If it&#x27;s safe to swim out of the beach using it, it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to hire an unsuspecting diver to plug it, or at least install better surveillance on it?</p><p>And who is in charge of tidying up the beach? The most fantastical feature of this geography would not be its aging properties but the capacity to fully reset the entire surface of the beach from any sort of remains from the previous cohort, without human intervention, while still keeping a bunch of things close to the rocks easy to dig up. Imagine the odds<br></p>]]></description>

Entertaining, even if not one of the greats. Great visuals, good acting. Some of the tropes are glaring and tiring. The New Yorker military grade man that builds his promised lake house for a romance that survives memory wiping technology. The plot core is decent sci fi, but several gaps make it easy target for criticism. Almost everything surrounding the scavengers is a bit of a mess, and the apparent stinginess in deploying drones, and the on and off surveillance capabilities of the enemies.</p><p>The ending is the weakest bit. The movie wrecks its already shaky defensibility by adding a totally unnecessary time skip, just to present us a kid. It’s basic and kind of stupid how that unfolds (and its implications).<br></p>]]></description>

It&#39;s incredible. Beautiful scenery, downtown to downtown in 35 minutes, check-in in 20 minutes - quicker than BC Ferries as a pedestrian... The noise isn&#39;t as bad as I thought, but it&#39;s still a solid 90 dB so an earplug is welcome.</p><p>The worst of it is the smell and the pollution from the fuel, and obviously the price. It&#39;s ten times the price of public transit for the route, but it&#39;s nearly ten times faster!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>finished reading <a href="https://neodb.social/~neodb~/book/3AGJYaT61Ucxvc1ZySrGuS" rel="nofollow">AI Superpowers</a> 🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑  <br>I like that the book presents a point of view that helps me understand a bit more the government role and technology development in China, escaping from the monolithic Silicon Valley ideology that embodies most talk about innovation and government intervention in &quot;the west&quot;. If you don&#x27;t read much about China and/or most of what you read related to Startups is from the USA, this is a good break from the gospel of &quot;the lean startup&quot; and the tyranny of infinitely scalable SaaS.</p><p>It was a bit rough to finish the read, though. It gets repetitive often, so I had a recurring feeling that the book could be half as long. There are few problematic points the author glosses over: capitalizing on poverty and precarious work conditions, cutthroat competition as role model, success measured by size and power. These might happen to be Dr. Lee&#x27;s own personal biases slipping through. But in the end this discomfort might be a reflection of my own western bias, as I had a hard time ignoring the differences in values when studying a mostly strategic analysis on growth and innovation.<br></p>]]></description>

I guess it was a fine work, but the experience of listening to this audiobook wasn&#x27;t that great, coming from someone that was mildly curious. There&#x27;s only so much one can do to spice up a bibliography that doesn&#x27;t derail into fiction. Halfway through I was listening the audiobook on 1.75x not really caring if something got lost.</p><p>I did learn a thing or two. John was a self absorbed dickhead; Paul was a bit nicer but not by a long margin; Gorge was stuck under their shadow; and Ringo was surviving the ride. They were brilliant musicians, very misguided and suggestible to bullshit. Understandable, considering their context and  the whirlwind that must be becoming world famous in your early twenties.</p><p>This was the ultimate Beatles read, in the sense that I don&#x27;t plan on ever reading anything about them ever again.<br></p>]]></description>
