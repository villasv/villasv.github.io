My long two-pointed ladder&amp;rsquo;s sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still,
And there&amp;rsquo;s a barrel that I didn&amp;rsquo;t fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn&amp;rsquo;t pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.

Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground,
The emptiness of ages in his face,
And on his back the burden of the world.</description></item><item><title>Stirrup Hoe</title><link>https://victor.villas/gardener/stirrup-hoe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/gardener/stirrup-hoe/</guid><description>â€œThe stirrup hoe, also called the oscillating, Appalachia, or shuffle hoe (buyer beware: several different styles of hoe are called shuffle hoes) has a U-shaped steel blade that swings through a small arc on the end of its too-short wooden handle. In fact, it looks just like a stirrup on a stick. As you draw it toward you, the blade runs under the soil and slices the weed (or whatever else is in its path) several inches below the surface.</description></item></channel></rss>
