My long two-pointed ladder&rsquo;s sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still,
And there&rsquo;s a barrel that I didn&rsquo;t fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn&rsquo;t pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
