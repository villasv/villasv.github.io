It&rsquo;s more important to be consistent than to be early. The first objective is to get the circadian rhythm in place so it can serve as foundation to a stable routine.

At that point, waking up happens on autopilot. The internal willpower battle is gone and you just do it. Sometimes you even do it when you&rsquo;re not supposed to, because you&rsquo;re not trying to instinctively escape it.</p><h2 id=bootstrap-reliability>Bootstrap Reliability</h2><p>The main goal here is to achieve end-to-end reliability, from waking up to the end of the morning routine: never miss the alarm, get out of bed as soon as possible, and never derail before completing the first activity of the day. Each of these can be a challenge on their own and requires different solutions.</p><h3 id=never-miss-an-alarm>Never Miss an Alarm</h3><p>#TODO

Something that is as much physical and as little thoughtful as possible. The kind of routine that you can perform half asleep, totally automatic. A few classic possibilities: taking a shower, <a href=/bodybuilder/morning-skin-care/>Morning Skin Care</a>, eating cereals etc. The specific routine depends on lifestyle choices but it should be something to be done every day without too much decision-making.</p><h2 id=bedtime-discipline>Bedtime Discipline</h2><p>The straightforward metric to track would be a direct measure of adherence to the scheduled start of the bedtime period. This isn&rsquo;t perfect because what really matters about being diligent on bedtime is to actually get the amount of sleep you need, so one might as well track sleep quantity and quality directly. Assuming consistency in wake up times, bedtime discipline is to be adjusted to deliver the necessary amount of rest.</p><p>Assuming The best metric to measure that would be the actual <em>Average Time Asleep</em> provided by sleep tracking.</p><p>Sleep early
