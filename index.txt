4:T63e,<p>finished watching <a href="https://neodb.social/~neodb~/movie/1Ko8MoPr0MYHgrrEAD2r08" rel="nofollow">Old</a> 🌕🌕🌑🌑🌑  <br>An interesting premise baited me into watching something I should have known better, given the trailer already shows a jumble of fodder characters.</p><p>Some lines of dialogue are straight up garbage. Also, what a shit touch to portray the therapist with totally useless interjections. Someone in this film crew doesn&#x27;t seem to believe this to be a real profession.</p><p>The plot tries too hard. I was willing to accept the selective effects of the aging vs growing with the unnecessary addition of high speed scarring, along the mysterious blockade that impedes people from leaving. That&#x27;s a bit too out there already in terms of bio sci fi, but workable as a premise. But it gets murkier on the details, like the specifics of some deaths.</p><p>And apparently this multi-billion dollar company and its scientists are smart enough to develop a cure for epilepsy but cannot find a way to plug a coral reef. If it&#x27;s safe to swim out of the beach using it, it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to hire an unsuspecting diver to plug it, or at least install better surveillance on it?</p><p>And who is in charge of tidying up the beach? The most fantastical feature of this geography would not be its aging properties but the capacity to fully reset the entire surface of the beach from any sort of remains from the previous cohort, without human intervention, while still keeping a bunch of things close to the rocks easy to dig up. Imagine the odds<br></p>5:T4a5,<p>finished reading <a href="https://neodb.social/~neodb~/book/6S6nTGAgbE1Qkm1HWGDPIh" rel="nofollow">Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents</a> 🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑  <br>I think there&#x27;s a certain audience for which this book is very much necessary, and I hope this audience comes across this book and make good use of it, because there&#x27;s much to gain. It&#x27;s specially important and useful for those who had, still have, or are still at risk of developing toxic relationships with loved ones. A big part of the book is built upon this theory of internal/external pathways to dealing with emotional hurdles, and this is a model most compatible with relationships that are closer to one of victim and aggressor.</p><p>For readers that have more nuanced relationships, I think this book still offers some nuggets of wisdom and a lot of food for thought, but not as much is applicable. It&#x27;s still possible to try and re-shape internalizer/externalizer to apply it situationally instead of categorically, but then we&#x27;re back again to just trying to learn how to be reasonable people, and the framing of the book becomes a distraction instead of an asset.<br></p>0:{"P":null,"b":"34S30UrU1NWlgHVP8teTh","p":"","c":["",""],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/08b55bcb0c0ae05f.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"styles_wrapper__CF5ak","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"styles_floater__KiCoV","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"styles_sidebar__SfMdw","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"styles_sidebar__SfMdw","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/","children":"Victor

Entertaining, even if not one of the greats. Great visuals, good acting. Some of the tropes are glaring and tiring. The New Yorker military grade man that builds his promised lake house for a romance that survives memory wiping technology. The plot core is decent sci fi, but several gaps make it easy target for criticism. Almost everything surrounding the scavengers is a bit of a mess, and the apparent stinginess in deploying drones, and the on and off surveillance capabilities of the enemies.</p><p>The ending is the weakest bit.
