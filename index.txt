4:T58f,<p><a href="https://neodb.social/~neodb~/book/3wxZDHmBrYhhMur7pTIP0b" rel="nofollow">Mem√≥rias P√≥stumas de Br√°s Cubas, 9 out of 10</a>  <br>Truly a landmark in the history of literature. This is a first crack in tainting the ideals of romanticism, using a dead narrator to excuse the grim and eschatological view of life and human struggles. The structure of the book, the whimsical choices, the events that transpire, they all conspire to a brilliant text. </p><p>The book is best enjoyed with a little bit of context on 1880&#x27;s Rio &amp; Brazil, but generous use of footnotes from the editor and a good deal of curiosity for research should suffice to get immersed.</p><p>The part of the book that I enjoyed the least was the middle of it, specifically the volume of attention dedicated to Virg√≠lia. But I also think that it is how it should be: so much time and energy and passion is dedicated to a romantic adventure that is ultimately unsatisfying and inconsequential, and the authors (the dead one and the real one) know this and decided for it, because that too is part of portraying a life.</p><p>It should go without saying but it&#x27;s always worth repeating that readers should keep in mind that the story is immersed in the zeitgeist of the 1880&#x27;s, so gender roles, slavery, social hierarchy are all described by someone who was living that reality without a contemporary lens of criticism.<br></p>5:T4e8,<p><a href="https://neodb.social/~neodb~/book/0pY9tyYHvu9nv2DOmpzkuc" rel="nofollow">Overdose, 9 out of 10</a>  <br>Honest, well research and comprehensive. This book is almost the perfect material to get introduced to an evidence-based approach to &quot;the war on drugs&quot;. That it was written by someone who was entirely embedded in conservative politics and grows a devout christian adds to the appeal to its universality.</p><p>The one flaw of the book, if it can even be called a fault instead of perhaps a missed opportunity, is the little discussion of the infertile grounds to sow the thesis, because this is one of the most important things we need right now to move forward with solutions. The current political climate is that of conservative leaders calling &quot;empathy&quot; weakness. A good chunk of the book is dedicated to dismantling the stigma, but this bias is a foundational character aspect of at least a third of us: rugged individualism cannot be argued out of someone&#x27;s core values and principles. How do we even get people to read this book cover to cover without triggering &quot;culture war&quot; reflexes of dismissal? I have no idea, and I guess it&#x27;s a different type of book that needs to address this.<br></p>0:{"P":null,"b":"PvqDCXOseo9IpxaYSJcHv","p":"","c":["",""],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/55650b6ac81b381d.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"styles_wrapper__CF5ak","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"styles_floater__KiCoV","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"styles_sidebar__SfMdw","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"styles_sidebar__SfMdw","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/","children":"Victor
