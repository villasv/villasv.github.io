4:T46a,<p>finished watching <a href="https://neodb.social/~neodb~/movie/1b6ScfaP29kS6ooalEN85y" rel="nofollow">Inside</a> 🌕🌕🌑🌑🌑  <br>I don&#x27;t know why Willem Dafoe does so many raw and gritty roles like this, but once again we have him doing a part of a human being in extreme conditions, mentally and physically. The movies make sure to not spare any details, you won&#x27;t be spared of a close up of a pile of human excrement. To be fair, his acting really goes above and beyond, and he succeeds in being insane and disgusting and desperate and pitiful and everything it seems they were going for. Like a blank canvas painted with a base layer of suffering, the viewer can finish the painting with a metaphor for any tragedy of the human condition.</p><p>Despite its conceptual achievements, I can&#x27;t really say this was an entertaining movie. Twenty minutes in, you know exactly what&#x27;s the movie going to be like for the next hour. Skipping to the last 20 minutes will not rob you of anything important. The ending is what it is. The whole movie really, it&#x27;s just that. A man who was trapped.<br></p>5:T661,

The robot&#x27;s personality and character plays a bigger role in this story, with longer dialogues and, matter of fact, staged monologues.
