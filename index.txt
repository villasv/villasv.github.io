4:T484,<p>finished reading <a href="https://neodb.social/~neodb~/book/6ysE3FRlE3h0zx7zrEuxgH" rel="nofollow">The Beatles</a> 🌕🌕🌑🌑🌑  <br>I don&#x27;t know how to evaluate Bob Spitz work, whether it&#x27;s accurate or simplistic, but it feels well researched and based on credible records. I guess it was a fine work, but the experience of listening to this audiobook wasn&#x27;t that great, coming from someone that was mildly curious. There&#x27;s only so much one can do to spice up a bibliography that doesn&#x27;t derail into fiction. Halfway through I was listening the audiobook on 1.75x not really caring if something got lost.</p><p>I did learn a thing or two. John was a self absorbed dickhead; Paul was a bit nicer but not by a long margin; Gorge was stuck under their shadow; and Ringo was surviving the ride. They were brilliant musicians, very misguided and suggestible to bullshit. Understandable, considering their context and  the whirlwind that must be becoming world famous in your early twenties.</p><p>This was the ultimate Beatles read, in the sense that I don&#x27;t plan on ever reading anything about them ever again.<br></p>0:{"P":null,"b":"EDmZFtHehQ14JNL-CJKhP","p":"","c":["",""],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/08b55bcb0c0ae05f.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"className":"styles_wrapper__CF5ak","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"styles_floater__KiCoV","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"styles_sidebar__SfMdw","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"styles_sidebar__SfMdw","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/","children":"Victor
