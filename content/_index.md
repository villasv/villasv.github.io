# Victor Villas'

This is my humble abode on the Worldwide Web. It is statically generated from a
flat-file database I manage and you can check out its sources on [GitHub][]. If
none of that made sense, no worries. I just like my website and wanted to tell
you about it. Maybe this encourages you to make your own as well?

You can always contact me at [my email][email] if you want to chat about
anything.
