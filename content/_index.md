# Victor Villas'

This is my humble website. It has no JavaScript, has around 15 lines of CSS, is statically generated with Hugo, hosted on GitHub Pages, exported from my private Obsidian notes (except for this very page). If none of that made sense, don't worry. I just like my website and wanted to tell you about it anyway. Maybe this encourages you to make your own as well?

You can always contact me at [my email][email] if you want to chat about anything.
