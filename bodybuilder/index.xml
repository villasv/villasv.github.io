For example, a 3 x 8-12 or simply a 3 x 10 set - the standard set for muscle growth because Hypertrophy is Optimal at 8-12 Repetitions.
These sets should use a moderate weight (close to 75% of your 1-rep maximum) such that you reach muscle failure - meaning you couldn&amp;rsquo;t execute another repetition no matter how much you wanted it.</description></item><item><title>Hypertrophy is optimal at 8-12 repetitions</title><link>https://victor.villas/bodybuilder/hypertrophy-is-optimal-at-812-repetitions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/bodybuilder/hypertrophy-is-optimal-at-812-repetitions/</guid><description>1-5 reps primarily develop strength, with more impact on muscle size and none on endurance. 6-12 reps develop a balance of strength, muscle size and endurance. 13-20 reps develop endurance, with some increases to muscle size and limited impact on strength.
Total mechanical tension, which is a key hypertrophy stimulus, can be maximized through moderate relative loads (e.g. 75% of 1RM) and high volume training (e.g. 10 sets of 10 reps) in comparison with high relative loads (e.</description></item><item><title>Joint Mobility Work Is Required Daily</title><link>https://victor.villas/bodybuilder/joint-mobility-work-is-required-daily/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/bodybuilder/joint-mobility-work-is-required-daily/</guid><description>Joint mobility work is necessary and should be done every morning. If you have a popping or creaking joint, double the work. If it is painful, move slower, consult with a professional and - with his consent - triple the work.
Because Every Set of Weight Training Should Reach Muscle Failure, joints are under a lot of stress during weight training. It is good to warm up before workouts, but it&amp;rsquo;s also good to do mobility work as a totally separate (earlier) session.</description></item><item><title>Morning Skin Care</title><link>https://victor.villas/bodybuilder/morning-skin-care/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/bodybuilder/morning-skin-care/</guid><description>#TODO
