# Who I am as a living person

I like to think of myself as a dilettante hopelessly pursuing a promotion to
polymath, even though I believe most people would say I'm just a specialist with
a knack for nosing around and aesthetic overzealousness. I take great pleasure
from beautiful uses of language and code,

```
like when antonyms have the same number of letters,
else many synonyms with all word widths as options,
fine gift allowing code and poem rivers to trickle;
```

or other ways in which poetry creeps into formal settings[[1]](#1).

# What I do with my resources

I spend most of my time in an effort to grok and architect technical solutions.
I believe technology is my best shot at a good impact because there are many low
hanging fruits that could be harvested in one fell swoop - if only I had an
ethical but scalable mechanism.

Some open source projects I've contributed to include Apache Airflow (and its
deployment[[2]](#2)) and educational material for Search Engineers[[3]](#3).

# Where I belong in this society

I've decided to focus on searching people. Not by name, not by address. By who
they really are, what they do, where they went and why they might want to be
found. This is why I joined Gupy[[4]](#4) in a journey to transform other
people's journey for personal fulfillment.
