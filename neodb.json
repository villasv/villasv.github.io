          "title": "Tyranny of the Minority: Why American Democracy Reached the Breaking Point",
          "description": "A call to reform our antiquated political institutions before it’s too late—from the New York Times bestselling authors of How Democracies Die\n \n America is undergoing a massive experiment: It is moving, in fits and starts, toward a multiracial democracy, something few societies have ever done. But the prospect of change has sparked an authoritarian backlash that threatens the very foundations of our political system. Why is this happening here, and not in other diversifying nations? And what can we do to save our democracy?\n \n With the clarity and brilliance that made their first book,  How Democracies Die,  a global bestseller, Harvard professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt offer a coherent framework for understanding these volatile times. They draw on a wealth of examples—from 1930s France to present-day Thailand—to explain why and how political parties turn against democracy: When political leaders realize they can no longer win at the ballot box, they begin to attack the system from within, condoning violent extremists and using the law as a weapon. Unfortunately, our Constitution makes us uniquely vulnerable. It is a pernicious enabler of minority rule, allowing partisan minorities to consistently thwart and even rule over popular majorities. Most modern democracies—from Germany and Sweden to Argentina and New Zealand—have eliminated outdated institutions like elite upper chambers, indirect elections, and lifetime tenure for judges. The United States lags dangerously behind.\n \n In this revelatory book, Levitsky and Ziblatt issue an urgent call to perfect our national experiment. It’s a daunting task, but we have remade our country before—most notably, after the Civil War and during the Progressive Era. And now we are at a crossroads: America will either become a multiracial democracy or it will cease to be a democracy at all.",

          "description": "A sly, sentimental, and wickedly funny memoir about growing up at the local fair. The PNE (Pacific National Exhibition) is a Vancouver tradition, an annual fair started in 1910 that is famous for its farm animals, dog trick shows, and amusement park highlighted by Canada’s oldest wooden roller coaster still in existence. In 1980, when Nick Marino was twelve years old, he started working at the PNE and quickly learned that there was more to the fair than winning stuffed animals and eating mini donuts. He had to contend with belligerent bosses, unhinged carnies, and teenage hustlers. In this funny, charming memoir of fair life, Marino revisits the “wild west” of the city’s East Side, home to the PNE, sharing stories from his six summers working at the fair, where arcade bouncers went on midnight roller coaster rides, riots broke out at concerts, and local kids helped themselves to everything. With beguiling and at times poignant humor, he pulls back the curtain on the culture of carnivals and fairs, an unpredictable and eternally young world of players, scammers, and dreamers. East Side Story is the latest addition to the Robin’s Egg Books series, which features some of the freshest, smartest, and above all, funniest writing on a variety of culturally relevant subjects.

          "description": "In this timely and profoundly original new book, bestselling writer and physician Gabor Maté looks at the epidemic of addictions in our society, tells us why we are so prone to them and what is needed to liberate ourselves from their hold on our emotions and behaviours.\n\nFor over seven years Gabor Maté has been the staff physician at the Portland Hotel, a residence and harm reduction facility in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. His patients are challenged by life-threatening drug addictions, mental illness, Hepatitis C or HIV and, in many cases, all four. But if Dr. Maté’s patients are at the far end of the spectrum, there are many others among us who are also struggling with addictions. Drugs, alcohol, tobacco, work, food, sex, gambling and excessive inappropriate spending: what is amiss with our lives that we seek such self-destructive ways to comfort ourselves? And why is it so difficult to stop these habits, even as they threaten our health, jeopardize our relationships and corrode our lives?\n\nBeginning with a dramatically close view of his drug addicted patients, Dr. Maté looks at his own history of compulsive behaviour. He weaves the stories of real people who have struggled with addiction with the latest research on addiction and the brain. Providing a bold synthesis of clinical experience, insight and cutting edge scientific findings, Dr. Maté sheds light on this most puzzling of human frailties. He proposes a compassionate approach to helping drug addicts and, for the many behaviour addicts among us, to addressing the void addiction is meant to fill.\n\nI believe there is one addiction process, whether it manifests in the lethal substance dependencies of my Downtown Eastside patients, the frantic self-soothing of overeaters or shopaholics, the obsessions of gamblers, sexaholics and compulsive internet users, or in the socially acceptable and even admired behaviours of the workaholic. Drug addicts are often dismissed and discounted as unworthy of empathy and respect. In telling their stories my intent is to help their voices to be heard and to shed light on the origins and nature of their ill-fated struggle to overcome suffering through substance use. Both in their flaws and their virtues they share much in common with the society that ostracizes them. If they have chosen a path to nowhere, they still have much to teach the rest of us. In the dark mirror of their lives we can trace outlines of our own.\n—from In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts",

His patients are challenged by life-threatening drug addictions, mental illness, Hepatitis C or HIV and, in many cases, all four. But if Dr. Maté’s patients are at the far end of the spectrum, there are many others among us who are also struggling with addictions. Drugs, alcohol, tobacco, work, food, sex, gambling and excessive inappropriate spending: what is amiss with our lives that we seek such self-destructive ways to comfort ourselves? And why is it so difficult to stop these habits, even as they threaten our health, jeopardize our relationships and corrode our lives?\n\nBeginning with a dramatically close view of his drug addicted patients, Dr. Maté looks at his own history of compulsive behaviour. He weaves the stories of real people who have struggled with addiction with the latest research on addiction and the brain. Providing a bold synthesis of clinical experience, insight and cutting edge scientific findings, Dr. Maté sheds light on this most puzzling of human frailties. He proposes a compassionate approach to helping drug addicts and, for the many behaviour addicts among us, to addressing the void addiction is meant to fill.\n\nI believe there is one addiction process, whether it manifests in the lethal substance dependencies of my Downtown Eastside patients, the frantic self-soothing of overeaters or shopaholics, the obsessions of gamblers, sexaholics and compulsive internet users, or in the socially acceptable and even admired behaviours of the workaholic. Drug addicts are often dismissed and discounted as unworthy of empathy and respect. In telling their stories my intent is to help their voices to be heard and to shed light on the origins and nature of their ill-fated struggle to overcome suffering through substance use. Both in their flaws and their virtues they share much in common with the society that ostracizes them. If they have chosen a path to nowhere, they still have much to teach the rest of us. In the dark mirror of their lives we can trace outlines of our own.\n—from In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts"

Fertile with mind-engorging insights,  The You You Are  is an invitation to merge with your true “You,” and expel from your essence the dead-eyed conventionalism that has defined your life since infancy.\n \n For the first time ever, Dr. Ricken’s luminous writings are available in digital format, only on Apple Books.

In addition, enjoy an exclusive letter of apology from the author himself, addressed to none other than YOU.\n \n In  Severance , Mark Scout (Adam Scott) leads a team at Lumon Industries, whose employees have undergone a severance procedure, which surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Mark - a widower who happens to be Dr. Ricken Hale’s brother in law - finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work … and of himself.\n \n Watch Severance, now streaming on Apple TV+.",

          "description": "ONE OF BARACK OBAMA'S FAVOURITE BOOKS OF 2024\n\n ‘An erudite and elegant meditation on modern life and modern love... Asya and Manu could very well be a couple in a novel by Sally Rooney or Caleb Azumah Nelson.' GUARDIAN\n\n ​'Immaculately observed... I found myself not wanting The Anthropologists to end.' FINANCIAL TIMES\n\n ‘Savaş’ prose is an X-ray – an acute portrait of the tender frequencies that make a life.’ RAVEN LEILANI\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n Asya and Manu are looking at apartments, envisioning their future in a foreign city. Removed from the web of family and its obligations, what traditions and rituals should they establish together?\n\n As they dream about the possibilities of each new listing, Asya, a documentary filmmaker, spends her days gathering footage from the neighbourhood park like an anthropologist observing local customs, anxious to know how people really live. ‘Forget about daily life,’ chides her grandmother on the phone, ‘no one cares about that.’\n\n Meanwhile, life back in Asya and Manu's respective home countries continues – parents age, grandparents get sick, nieces and nephews grow up – all just slightly beyond their reach. But the world they're making in their new city is growing, too, they hope. As they open up the horizons of their lives, what and whom will they hold onto, and what will they need to release?\n\nUnfolding over a series of apartment viewings, late-night conversations, last rounds of drinks and lazy breakfasts, The Anthropologists is a soulful examination of home-building and modern love, written with Aysegül Savaş’ distinctive elegance, warmth and humour.\n __________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPraise for THE ANTHROPOLOGISTS\n\n ‘The Anthropologists is about love, youth, and that most profound and elusive of subjects – happiness. Full of delicacy, wisdom and wit, this is another gorgeous work from one of my favourite writers.’ KATIE KITAMURA\n   \n ‘Like Walter Benjamin, Ayşegül Savaş uncovers trapdoors to bewilderment everywhere in everyday life; like Henry James, she sees marriage as a mystery, unsoundably deep. The Anthropologists is mesmerising; I felt I read it in a single breath.’ GARTH GREENWELL\n  \n ‘Yet another gorgeous, gorgeous book from Aysegül Savaş: she is an author who simply, and astoundingly, knows. Savaş knows hope. Savaş knows despair. Savaş knows joy, and malaise, and laughter and curiosity. There are worlds inside of Savaş' prose, and The Anthropologists is both a bright light and a map for how to be. A massively heartening achievement.’ BRYAN WASHINGTON",

The world is becoming more volatile, and people are understandably worried about their financial futures. In this urgent and accessible guide to the crises and opportunities that lie ahead, economist and former Governor of the Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz maps out the powerful tectonic forces that are shaping our future, and the ideas that will allow us to master them.\n\nThese forces include an aging workforce, mounting debt, and rising income inequality. Technological advances, too, are adding to the pressure, putting people out of work, and climate change is forcing a transition to a lower-carbon economy. It is no surprise that people are feeling uncertain.\n\nThe implications of these tectonic tensions will cascade throughout every dimension of our lives—the job market, the housing market, the investment climate, as well as government and central bank policy, and the role of the corporation within society. The pandemic has added momentum to many of them. \n\nPoloz skillfully argues that past crises, from the Victorian Depression in the late 1800s to the more recent downturn in 2008, give a hint of what is in store for us in the decades ahead. Unlike the purely destructive power of earthquakes, the upheaval that is sure to come in the decades ahead will offer unexpected opportunities for renewal and growth.\n\nFilled with takeaways for employers, investors, and policymakers, as well as families discussing jobs and mortgage renewals around the kitchen table, The Next Age of Uncertainty is an indispensable guide for those navigating the fault lines of the risky world ahead.",

The world is becoming more volatile, and people are understandably worried about their financial futures. In this urgent and accessible guide to the crises and opportunities that lie ahead, economist and former Governor of the Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz maps out the powerful tectonic forces that are shaping our future, and the ideas that will allow us to master them.\n\nThese forces include an aging workforce, mounting debt, and rising income inequality. Technological advances, too, are adding to the pressure, putting people out of work, and climate change is forcing a transition to a lower-carbon economy. It is no surprise that people are feeling uncertain.\n\nThe implications of these tectonic tensions will cascade throughout every dimension of our lives—the job market, the housing market, the investment climate, as well as government and central bank policy, and the role of the corporation within society. The pandemic has added momentum to many of them. \n\nPoloz skillfully argues that past crises, from the Victorian Depression in the late 1800s to the more recent downturn in 2008, give a hint of what is in store for us in the decades ahead. Unlike the purely destructive power of earthquakes, the upheaval that is sure to come in the decades ahead will offer unexpected opportunities for renewal and growth.\n\nFilled with takeaways for employers, investors, and policymakers, as well as families discussing jobs and mortgage renewals around the kitchen table, The Next Age of Uncertainty is an indispensable guide for those navigating the fault lines of the risky world ahead."

          "description": "Jeff Speck has spent his career determining what makes a city work, and he has boiled it down to one essential factor: walkability. For urban life to thrive, cities must prioritize pedestrians over cars. Six-lane highways tearing through downtown must give way to crossable streets, massive parking lots must give way to pedestrian plazas, architecture designed to be appreciated from afar must give way to welcoming buildings. Making all of this happen is relatively easy and cheap; seeing what needs to be done is the trick. Speck can show us the invisible workings underneath the city, how simple decisions have cascading effects, and how we can make the right decisions for our cities. Cities have been recognized as the key to sustainable living. But New York, San Francisco, Chicago, D.C. - these are not the next great American cities, and they are not where the future of urban life will be formed. Most Americans live in midsize cities - Lowell, Massachusetts; Tacoma, Washington; Grand Rapids, Michigan - that need downtowns that are vibrant and appealing; they need to feel like the urban hubs that they are. They need walkability. Bursting with sharp observations and real-world examples, giving key insight to what urban planners actually do and how cities can and do change, \"Walkable City\" lays out a practical, necessary, and eminently achievable vision of how to make our American cities work.",

It’s time to escape. In Escaping the Housing Trap: The Strong Towns Response to the Housing Crisis, renowned urbanists Charles (Chuck) Marohn and Daniel Herriges introduce a first-of-its-kind discussion of the tension between housing as a financial product and housing as shelter. This is the key insight that’s been missing from the Housing Crisis Conversation; and the insight that can help cities fight back against the crisis from the bottom-up.\n\nThis book offers a serious, yet accessible, history of housing policy in the United States and explains how it led us to this point in time: where we face a market that is rigged against people who, only a few decades ago, could have been homeowners or stable, long-term rentals. Only local change, on a neighborhood or city-wide scale, can begin to restore balance to the housing market. Escaping the Housing Trap is the must-read resource for everyone with a stake in the future of housing in America—and that means everyone. Readers will find:  Discussions of housing as an investment and how the country's neighborhoods are being transformed by the introduction of large amounts of investment Explorations of housing as shelter, including discussions of zoning policy and NIMBYism A comprehensive overview of the Strong Towns approach to solving the American housing crisis   ",

          "brief": "Housing is an investment. Investment prices must go up. Housing is shelter. When the price of shelter goes up, people experience distress.\n\nThis is the housing trap. It’s time to escape. In Escaping the Housing Trap: The Strong Towns Response to the Housing Crisis, renowned urbanists Charles (Chuck) Marohn and Daniel Herriges introduce a first-of-its-kind discussion of the tension between housing as a financial product and housing as shelter. This is the key insight that’s been missing from the Housing Crisis Conversation; and the insight that can help cities fight back against the crisis from the bottom-up.\n\nThis book offers a serious, yet accessible, history of housing policy in the United States and explains how it led us to this point in time: where we face a market that is rigged against people who, only a few decades ago, could have been homeowners or stable, long-term rentals. Only local change, on a neighborhood or city-wide scale, can begin to restore balance to the housing market. Escaping the Housing Trap is the must-read resource for everyone with a stake in the future of housing in America—and that means everyone. Readers will find:  Discussions of housing as an investment and how the country's neighborhoods are being transformed by the introduction of large amounts of investment Explorations of housing as shelter, including discussions of zoning policy and NIMBYism A comprehensive overview of the Strong Towns approach to solving the American housing crisis   ",

          "description": "‘Sir Ernest Shackleton and his crew make today’s hightech adventurers look like dilettantes. Their interminable voyage across frozen land and open sea is one of the most harrowing survival stories of all time.’ Sebastian Junger, author of the bestselling The Perfect Storm.\nIn 1914 Sir Ernest Shackleton and a crew of 27 men set sail for the South Atlantic on board the Endurance. The object of the expedition was to cross the Antarctic overland. In October 1915, still half a continent away from their intended base, the ship was trapped, then crushed in ice. For seventeen months Shackleton and his men, drifting on ice packs and then on the stormiest seas on the globe, were castaways in this most savage region of the world.\nFrank Hurley, the photographer of the expedition, documented their struggles, miraculously saving his negatives and photographs from destruction at each stage of their journey. His photographs illustrate the dramatic, terrible beauty of the lands with which they were contending. They also provide an unsurpassable insight into the extraordinary spirit of Shackleton and his crew, and their extraordinary indefatigability and lasting civility towards one another in the most adverse conditions.\nLansing’s gripping narrative, based on firsthand accounts of crew members and interviews with survivors, vividly describes how the men lived together in camps on the ice until they reached land, how they were attacked by sea leopards, ate sea lion and polar bear, developed frostbite (an operation to amputate the foot of one member of the crew was carried out on the ice), and finally embarked on a 850-mile voyage in a 22-foot open lifeboat to find help.",

Their interminable voyage across frozen land and open sea is one of the most harrowing survival stories of all time.’ Sebastian Junger, author of the bestselling The Perfect Storm.\nIn 1914 Sir Ernest Shackleton and a crew of 27 men set sail for the South Atlantic on board the Endurance. The object of the expedition was to cross the Antarctic overland. In October 1915, still half a continent away from their intended base, the ship was trapped, then crushed in ice. For seventeen months Shackleton and his men, drifting on ice packs and then on the stormiest seas on the globe, were castaways in this most savage region of the world.\nFrank Hurley, the photographer of the expedition, documented their struggles, miraculously saving his negatives and photographs from destruction at each stage of their journey. His photographs illustrate the dramatic, terrible beauty of the lands with which they were contending. They also provide an unsurpassable insight into the extraordinary spirit of Shackleton and his crew, and their extraordinary indefatigability and lasting civility towards one another in the most adverse conditions.\nLansing’s gripping narrative, based on firsthand accounts of crew members and interviews with survivors, vividly describes how the men lived together in camps on the ice until they reached land, how they were attacked by sea leopards, ate sea lion and polar bear, developed frostbite (an operation to amputate the foot of one member of the crew was carried out on the ice), and finally embarked on a 850-mile voyage in a 22-foot open lifeboat to find help."

          "description": "A “meticulously researched and buoyantly written” ( Esquire ) look at what happens when we talk to strangers, and why it affects everything from our own health and well-being to the rise and fall of nations in the tradition of Susan Cain’s Quiet and Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens\n \n “This lively, searching work makes the case that welcoming ‘others’ isn’t just the bedrock of civilization, it’s the surest path to the best of what life has to offer.”—Ayad Akhtar, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Homeland Elegies\n \n In our cities, we stand in silence at the pharmacy and in check-out lines at the grocery store, distracted by our phones, barely acknowledging one another, even as rates of loneliness skyrocket. Online, we retreat into ideological silos reinforced by algorithms designed to serve us only familiar ideas and like-minded users. In our politics, we are increasingly consumed by a fear of people we’ve never met. But what if strangers—so often blamed for our most pressing political, social, and personal problems—are actually the solution?\n \n In The Power of Strangers, Joe Keohane sets out on a journey to discover what happens when we bridge the distance between us and people we don’t know. He learns that while we’re wired to sometimes fear, distrust, and even hate strangers, people and societies that have learned to connect with strangers benefit immensely. Digging into a growing body of cutting-edge research on the surprising social and psychological benefits that come from talking to strangers, Keohane finds that even passing interactions can enhance empathy, happiness, and cognitive development, ease loneliness and isolation, and root us in the world, deepening our sense of belonging. And all the while, Keohane gathers practical tips from experts on how to talk to strangers, and tries them out himself in the wild, to awkward, entertaining, and frequently poignant effect.\n \n Warm, witty, erudite, and profound, equal parts sweeping history and self-help journey, this deeply researched book will inspire readers to see everything—from major geopolitical shifts to trips to the corner store—in an entirely new light, showing them that talking to strangers isn’t just a way to live; it’s a way to survive.",

          "description": "Our competitive, service-oriented societies are taking a toll on the late-modern individual. Rather than improving life, multitasking, \"user-friendly\" technology, and the culture of convenience are producing disorders that range from depression to attention deficit disorder to borderline personality disorder. Byung-Chul Han interprets the spreading malaise as an inability to manage negative experiences in an age characterized by excessive positivity and the universal availability of people and goods. Stress and exhaustion are not just personal experiences, but social and historical phenomena as well. Denouncing a world in which every against-the-grain response can lead to further disempowerment, he draws on literature, philosophy, and the social and natural sciences to explore the stakes of sacrificing intermittent intellectual reflection for constant neural connection.",

The book is a social critique written as a philosophy graduate essay: a lot of time is spent on stating analogies to describe modern society defended by other philosophers only to say that the description is inaccurate because so and so. The book has some pillar concepts related to \"achievement society\" but routinely reaches for unnecessary analogies to immune systems or alternative framings like positivity/negativity. The audience is people who read Heidegger instead of people who do want to understand burnout society.",

This is a first crack in tainting the ideals of romanticism, using a dead narrator to excuse the grim and eschatological view of life and human struggles. The structure of the book, the whimsical choices, the events that transpire, they all conspire to a brilliant text. \r\n\r\nThe book is best enjoyed with a little bit of context on 1880's Rio & Brazil, but generous use of footnotes from the editor and a good deal of curiosity for research should suffice to get immersed.\r\n\r\nThe part of the book that I enjoyed the least was the middle of it, specifically the volume of attention dedicated to Virgília. But I also think that it is how it should be: so much time and energy and passion is dedicated to a romantic adventure that is ultimately unsatisfying and inconsequential, and the authors (the dead one and the real one) know this and decided for it, because that too is part of portraying a life.\r\n\r\nIt should go without saying but it's always worth repeating that readers should keep in mind that the story is immersed in the zeitgeist of the 1880's, so gender roles, slavery, social hierarchy are all described by someone who was living that reality without a contemporary lens of criticism.",

That it was written by someone who was entirely embedded in conservative politics and grows a devout christian adds to the appeal to its universality.\r\n\r\nThe one flaw of the book, if it can even be called a fault instead of perhaps a missed opportunity, is the little discussion of the infertile grounds to sow the thesis, because this is one of the most important things we need right now to move forward with solutions. The current political climate is that of conservative leaders calling \"empathy\" weakness. A good chunk of the book is dedicated to dismantling the stigma, but this bias is a foundational character aspect of at least a third of us: rugged individualism cannot be argued out of someone's core values and principles. How do we even get people to read this book cover to cover without triggering \"culture war\" reflexes of dismissal? I have no idea, and I guess it's a different type of book that needs to address this.",

By establishing that contact, some extra world-building happens - some great and some not so much. We are sold the idea that robots willingly avoid using digital communication protocols, avoid integrating with knowledge databases or even mere calculators, and avoid repairing themselves because they just accept death. The robot's personality and character plays a bigger role in this story, with longer dialogues and, matter of fact, staged monologues. The robot taps into several combined tropes: innocently insensitive, fish out of water, simple-minded wisdom. Well, my annoyance makes me empathize with Dex having to deal with all that, so the books still works somehow.",

But even when we don’t resort to violence, we routinely do ridiculous things for parking, contorting our professional, social, and financial lives to get a spot. Indeed, in the century since the advent of the car, we have deformed—and in some cases demolished—our homes and our cities in a Sisyphean quest for cheap and convenient car storage. As a result, much of the nation’s most valuable real estate is now devoted exclusively to empty and idle vehicles, even as so many Americans struggle to find affordable housing. Parking determines the design of new buildings and the fate of old ones, patterns of traffic and the viability of transit, neighborhood politics and municipal finance, the quality of public space, and even the course of floodwaters. Can this really be the best use of our finite resources and space? Why have we done this to the places we love? Is parking  really  more important than anything else?\n \n These are the questions  Slate  staff writer Henry Grabar sets out to answer, telling a mesmerizing story about the strange and wonderful superorganism that is the modern American city. In a beguiling and often absurdly hilarious mix of history, politics, and reportage, Grabar brilliantly surveys the pain points of the nation’s parking crisis, from Los Angeles to Disney World to New York, stopping at every major American city in between.

It's a bit of a depressing read for most chapters, and I wasn't very interested in the personal life details of the people involved on the relevant developments cited, but I guess it makes sense to add a human touch when describing the people campaigning for change if you're writing a book for people that tend to vilify progress with fantastic ulterior motives. This is a good introductory book for understanding motonormativity, and using parking of all things is a good entryway by making use of people's general obsession with it.",

This is the rare non-fiction book that does NOT draw the reader towards The One Book mindset - where a concept is overstretched until it becomes a hammer capable of nailing all screws known to humankind.\r\n\r\nI think the structural design of the book works well. As expected from a philosopher, the thesis is built from the ground up and a lot of effort is put into what these concepts are _not_ saying. I like it, but I can imagine that readers not used to the extra precision and nitpicking common to philosophy writers will find it a bit dry or dense at times.\r\n\r\nThe one small gripe I have is that after all this effort, the final chapter ends up playing like a shortcut. The case for animals having a concept of death brought by the distinction between tonic immobility and thanatosis (faking death, aka playing possum) and what this tells us about predators is mostly not dependant on the framework the book invests in building. It's such a strong case, it feels like the core issue is answered by reading the first two or three chapters plus the last one, and everything in between is superfluous - but even the filler was very interesting to me, so it was time well spent anyway.",

          "description": "If you grew up with an emotionally immature, unavailable, or selfish parent, you may have lingering feelings of anger, loneliness, betrayal, or abandonment. You may recall your childhood as a time when your emotional needs were not met, when your feelings were dismissed, or when you took on adult levels of responsibility in an effort to compensate for your parent’s behavior. These wounds can be healed, and you can move forward in your life.\nIn this breakthrough book, clinical psychologist Lindsay Gibson exposes the destructive nature of parents who are emotionally immature or unavailable.

Finally, you’ll learn how to create positive, new relationships so you can build a better life.\nDiscover the four types of difficult parents:\nThe emotional parent instills feelings of instability and anxiety\nThe driven parent stays busy trying to perfect everything and everyone\nThe passive parent avoids dealing with anything upsetting\nThe rejecting parent is withdrawn, dismissive, and derogatory",

It's specially important and useful for those who had, still have, or are still at risk of developing toxic relationships with loved ones. A big part of the book is built upon this theory of internal/external pathways to dealing with emotional hurdles, and this is a model most compatible with relationships that are closer to one of victim and aggressor.\r\n\r\nFor readers that have more nuanced relationships, I think this book still offers some nuggets of wisdom and a lot of food for thought, but not as much is applicable. It's still possible to try and re-shape internalizer/externalizer to apply it situationally instead of categorically, but then we're back again to just trying to learn how to be reasonable people, and the framing of the book becomes a distraction instead of an asset.",

It reads like a personal adventure journal, with brief intermissions for more context and flair. The author is very passionate about both topics, which is good for the content as very few writers would subject themselves to similar adventures, but also jeopardizes the objectiveness when presenting evidence or making the case for their personal beliefs. Not surprisingly, no real counter-argument or case against the main thesis are seriously discussed, it's all hand-waved out of the way with imaginary debates easily won by the author.",

          "description": "In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be \"positive\" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.\nFor decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \"F**k positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.\nManson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.\nThere are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.",

The book reads like ‘The Coddling of the American Mind’ but targeting self-help readers instead - a conservative subtext sprinkled throughout the chapters. We all know what “entitlement” is meant to signify in the cases not said out loud.",

          "description": "This revolutionary approach to cleaning and organizing helps free you from feeling ashamed or overwhelmed by a messy home.\nIf you’re struggling to stay on top of your to-do list, you probably have a good reason: anxiety, fatigue, depression, ADHD, or lack of support. For therapist KC Davis, the birth of her second child triggered a stress-mess cycle. The more behind she felt, the less motivated she was to start. She didn’t fold a single piece of laundry for seven months. One life-changing realization restored her sanity—and the functionality of her home: You don’t work for your home; your home works for you.\nIn other words, messiness is not a moral failing. A new sense of calm washed over her as she let go of the shame-based messaging that interpreted a pile of dirty laundry as “I can never keep up” and a chaotic kitchen as “I’m a bad mother.” Instead, she looked at unwashed clothes and thought, “I am alive,” and at stacks of dishes and thought, “I cooked my family dinner three nights in a row.”\nBuilding on this foundation of self-compassion, KC devised the powerful practical approach that has exploded in popularity through her TikTok account, @domesticblisters. The secret is to simplify your to-do list and to find creative workarounds that accommodate your limited time and energy. In this book, you’ll learn exactly how to customize your cleaning strategy and rebuild your relationship with your home, including:\n-How to see chores as kindnesses to your future self, not as a reflection of your worth\n-How to start by setting priorities\n-How to stagger tasks so you won’t procrastinate\n-How to clean in quick bursts within your existing daily routine\n-How to use creative shortcuts to transform a room from messy to functional\nWith KC’s help, your home will feel like a sanctuary again. It will become a place to rest, even when things aren’t finished. You will move with ease, and peace and calm will edge out guilt, self-criticism, and endless checklists. They have no place here.",

And it’s making us lonelier, more isolated, and less tolerant than ever before. A listener by trade, New York Times contributor Kate Murphy wanted to know how we got here.\nIn this always illuminating and often humorous deep dive, Murphy explains why we’re not listening, what it’s doing to us, and how we can reverse the trend. She makes accessible the psychology, neuroscience, and sociology of listening while also introducing us to some of the best listeners out there (including a CIA agent, focus group moderator, bartender, radio producer, and top furniture salesman). Equal parts cultural observation, scientific exploration, and rousing call to action that's full of practical advice, You're Not Listening is to listening what Susan Cain's Quiet was to introversion. It’s time to stop talking and start listening.",

          "description": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A practical, heartfelt guide to the art of truly knowing another person in order to foster deeper connections at home, at work, and throughout our lives—from the author of The Road to Character and The Second Mountain\n\nAs David Brooks observes, “There is one skill that lies at the heart of any healthy person, family, school, community organization, or society: the ability to see someone else deeply and make them feel seen—to accurately know another person, to let them feel valued, heard, and understood.”\n\nAnd yet we humans don’t do this well. All around us are people who feel invisible, unseen, misunderstood. In How to Know a Person, Brooks sets out to help us do better, posing questions that are essential for all of us: If you want to know a person, what kind of attention should you cast on them? What kind of conversations should you have? What parts of a person’s story should you pay attention to?\n\n Driven by his trademark sense of curiosity and his determination to grow as a person, Brooks draws from the fields of psychology and neuroscience and from the worlds of theater, philosophy, history, and education to present a welcoming, hopeful, integrated approach to human connection. How to Know a Person helps readers become more understanding and considerate toward others, and to find the joy that comes from being seen. Along the way it offers a possible remedy for a society that is riven by fragmentation, hostility, and misperception.\n\n The act of seeing another person, Brooks argues, is profoundly creative: How can we look somebody in the eye and see something large in them, and in turn, see something larger in ourselves? How to Know a Person is for anyone searching for connection, and yearning to be understood.",

What she learned was that librarians are expected to serve as mediators and mental-health-crisis support professionals, customer service reps and administrators of overdose treatment, fierce loyalists to institutionalized mythology and enforced silence, and arms of state surveillance.\n\n Based on firsthand experiences from six years of professional work as a librarian in high-poverty neighborhoods of Washington, DC, as well as interviews and research, Overdue begins with Oliver's first day at Northwest One, the DC Public Library branch where she would ultimately end her library career.\n\n Through her experience at this branch, Oliver highlights the national problems that have existed in libraries since they were founded, troublingly at odds with the common romanticization of the library as a shining beacon of equality: racism, segregation, and economic oppression. These fundamental American problems manifest today as police violence, the opioid epidemic, widespread inaccessibility of affordable housing, and a lack of mental health care nationwide—all of which come to a head in public library spaces.\n\n Can public librarians continue to play the many roles they are tasked with? Can American society sustain one of its most noble institutions?\n\nLibraries will not save us, but Oliver helps us imagine what might be possible if we stop expecting them to.\n",

          "description": "If falling in love is the peak of human experience, then marriage is the slow descent down that mountain, on a trail built from conflict, compromise, and nagging doubts. Considering the limited economic advantages to marriage, the deluge of other mate options a swipe away, and the fact that almost half of all marriages in the United States end in divorce anyway, why do so many of us still chain ourselves to one human being for life?\nIn\n, Heather Havrilesky illustrates the delights, aggravations, and sublime calamities of her marriage over the span of fifteen years, charting an unpredictable course from meeting her one true love to slowly learning just how much energy is required to keep that love aflame. This refreshingly honest portrait of a marriage reveals that our relationships are not simply \"happy\" or \"unhappy,\" but something much murkier--at once unsavory, taxing, and deeply satisfying. With tales of fumbled proposals, harrowing suburban migrations, external temptations, and the bewildering insults of growing older,\nis a work of rare candor and insight. Havrilesky traces a path from daydreaming about forever for the first time to understanding what a tedious, glorious drag forever can be.",

          "brief": "Pollan takes us on a journey through the history of the drug, which was first discovered in a small part of East Africa and within a century became an addiction affecting most of the human species. Caffeine, it turns out, has changed the course of human history - won and lost wars, changed politics, dominated economies. What's more, the author shows that the Industrial Revolution would have been impossible without it. The science of how the drug has evolved to addict us is no less fascinating.",

If you don't read much about China and/or most of what you read related to Startups is from the USA, this is a good break from the gospel of \"the lean startup\" and the tyranny of infinitely scalable SaaS.\r\n\r\nIt was a bit rough to finish the read, though. It gets repetitive often, so I had a recurring feeling that the book could be half as long. There are few problematic points the author glosses over: capitalizing on poverty and precarious work conditions, cutthroat competition as role model, success measured by size and power. These might happen to be Dr. Lee's own personal biases slipping through. But in the end this discomfort might be a reflection of my own western bias, as I had a hard time ignoring the differences in values when studying a mostly strategic analysis on growth and innovation.",

I guess it was a fine work, but the experience of listening to this audiobook wasn't that great, coming from someone that was mildly curious. There's only so much one can do to spice up a bibliography that doesn't derail into fiction. Halfway through I was listening the audiobook on 1.75x not really caring if something got lost.\r\n\r\nI did learn a thing or two. John was a self absorbed dickhead; Paul was a bit nicer but not by a long margin; Gorge was stuck under their shadow; and Ringo was surviving the ride. They were brilliant musicians, very misguided and suggestible to bullshit. Understandable, considering their context and  the whirlwind that must be becoming world famous in your early twenties.\r\n\r\nThis was the ultimate Beatles read, in the sense that I don't plan on ever reading anything about them ever again.",

Maybe she won the genetics lottery for flavour perception, or maybe it's all fruit of her hard work; in any case it's pretty amazing that a random person could train to geo-guess wines.",

I enjoyed the central role that music played in the story, and it's not as if >!vampires!< ever needed justification to attack people but this tried something different so that's fun. I do think the villains are a bit overpowered, though, to a point where it's hard to believe they wouldn't be more widely known through folk tales, but that's a bit of world building nitpicking. I also found the epilogue a bit too \"fan service\" - of course it's rewarding to watch >!klan racists be rampaged by the protagonist!< but the whole scene was a bit too obvious.",

The humour of the movie is a bit high on mockery, to a point that it's a bit disingenuous and excessively cynical towards contemporary issues, but I understand that this is a part of the representation of the universe an old coot is living in. At least the main character isn't all too contrarian, he's an intellectual of sorts, so of course he's portrayed as sensible and fair. The story is an attempt to rescue people from centring their lives around what they believe in and bring them towards human connection, which is crucial specially for those of us in the twilight of our years.",

        "comment_text": "I don't know why Willem Dafoe does so many raw and gritty roles like this, but once again we have him doing a part of a human being in extreme conditions, mentally and physically. The movies make sure to not spare any details, you won't be spared of a close up of a pile of human excrement. To be fair, his acting really goes above and beyond, and he succeeds in being insane and disgusting and desperate and pitiful and everything it seems they were going for. Like a blank canvas painted with a base layer of suffering, the viewer can finish the painting with a metaphor for any tragedy of the human condition.\r\n\r\nDespite its conceptual achievements, I can't really say this was an entertaining movie. Twenty minutes in, you know exactly what's the movie going to be like for the next hour. Skipping to the last 20 minutes will not rob you of anything important. The ending is what it is. The whole movie really, it's just that. A man who was trapped.",

Also, what a shit touch to portray the therapist with totally useless interjections. Someone in this film crew doesn't seem to believe this to be a real profession.\r\n\r\n>!The plot tries too hard. I was willing to accept the selective effects of the aging vs growing with the unnecessary addition of high speed scarring, along the mysterious blockade that impedes people from leaving. That's a bit too out there already in terms of bio sci fi, but workable as a premise. But it gets murkier on the details, like the specifics of some deaths.\r\n\r\nAnd apparently this multi-billion dollar company and its scientists are smart enough to develop a cure for epilepsy but cannot find a way to plug a coral reef. If it's safe to swim out of the beach using it, it shouldn't be hard to hire an unsuspecting diver to plug it, or at least install better surveillance on it?\r\n\r\nAnd who is in charge of tidying up the beach? The most fantastical feature of this geography would not be its aging properties but the capacity to fully reset the entire surface of the beach from any sort of remains from the previous cohort, without human intervention, while still keeping a bunch of things close to the rocks easy to dig up.

Hennes ankomst utløser en rekke hendelser som tvinger ham til å sette spørsmålstegn ved alt han trodde han visste. Med ett ligger menneskehetens skjebne i Jacks hender.

The New Yorker military grade man that builds his promised lake house for a romance that survives memory wiping technology. The plot core is decent sci fi, but several gaps make it easy target for criticism. Almost everything surrounding the scavengers is a bit of a mess, and the apparent stinginess in deploying drones, and the on and off surveillance capabilities of the enemies.\r\n\r\nThe ending is the weakest bit. The movie wrecks its already shaky defensibility by adding a totally unnecessary time skip, just to present us a kid. It’s basic and kind of stupid how that unfolds (and its implications).",

I guess it's fair to expect that Saang-Il and Young-Mi develop slowly as any normal pair of middle-aged adults, but I expected more from Jung and Janet. But well, we're here for it anyway. At this point we're used to not expect much other than a pastime, mostly lighthearted and mostly wholesome, still sometimes a bit too silly, sometimes too stereotypical. The season ends with a bit of a cliffhanger but the series was canceled so it is what it is.",

Unfortunately, expectations might have gotten out of hand and a few episodes were disappointing. It's as if directors are now operating in the comfort zone of an existing and forgiving fanbase, different from when they weren't sure if the series would be a hit. Woe's Hollow was too out there, Sweet Vitriol and Atilla were good attempts but ultimately unsatisfying. Jessica Lee Gangné rocks and Chickhai Bardo was a beautiful and excellent episode, and so was the season finale - both made the season worth it, and I'm looking forward to a third season after a few learned lessons.",

I don’t understand why the series had to make Camille be so sensitive to alcohol that she bleeds like a fountain after a shot/kiss, proceeds to confirm this to be a result of trauma with a lengthy brain-doctor scene, only to resolve this major life condition in a single moment of clarity. The writers could not make up their mind whether her childhood was traumatic or not, and suddenly it does a 180. Instead of a major trauma, what’s left from her childhood is the bounty of all her training, exposed slowly in a sequence of “time to unlock more true potential” episodes.!<\r\n\r\nThis contortion takes nearly a third the series for no good reason other than an attempt to reconcile common East-Asian tropes (hard training, wisdom of seniors) with common Western tropes (rural rich, sacrifices for success, life scars, youth freedom). It doesn’t work well to me, and for the most part I was more interested in Issei as a character because he was made complex in a similar way but without glaring inconsistencies.",

The story is just so well timed, the corporate world has never felt so bleak and COVID-19 along with the approaching \"return to office\" mandates cemented the perfect stage. It starts a bit slow and perhaps only relatable to those immersed in white-collar culture, but it picks up the pace to become a suspense/thriller of general appeal.",
