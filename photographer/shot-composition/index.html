A simple trick: show the ground. This shows how far the subject is from the photographer.</p><h2 id=filling-the-frame>Filling the Frame</h2><p>Adding objects to the foreground to generate an &ldquo;inside frame&rdquo; for the subject, replacing dead space. This is a matter of style and personal choice.</p><h2 id=storytelling>Storytelling</h2><p>Bring the viewer into an adventure with you. Examples: using vantage point to portray the path ahead; using perspective to show how big the world is; using surrounding light to silhouette and hide the person into anonymity;</p><h2 id=long-exposure-photography>Long Exposure Photography</h2><p>Keeping the shutter open longer blurs moving objects and absorbs more light. Interesting for smoothing water on shooting in the dark. Can be done by converting a Live Photo!</p><h2 id=macro-photography>Macro Photography</h2><p>Shooting extreme close ups. Ideally you have a special lens for it, but today&rsquo;s versatile lens can do a pretty good job with regular focus control.</p><h2 id=panoramic-mode>Panoramic Mode</h2><p>It usually looks far too stretched and weird.
