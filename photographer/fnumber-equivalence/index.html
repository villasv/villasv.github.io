That&rsquo;s why f-number is useful in the first place: to reduce the <a href=/photographer/focal-length/>Focal Length</a> and <a href=/photographer/aperture/>Aperture</a> diameter combination into a single variable that completely describes the lens influence on <a href=/photographer/exposure/>Exposure</a>.</p><p>However, different sensor sizes will play a role on the <a href=/photographer/depth-of-field/>Depth of Field</a>.

The same f-number will yield the same <a href=/photographer/exposure/>Exposure</a> but a different <a href=/photographer/depth-of-field/>Depth of Field</a>, meanwhile with equivalent focal lengths the same <a href=/photographer/aperture/>Aperture</a> diameter will yield a different <a href=/photographer/exposure/>Exposure</a> but the same <a href=/photographer/depth-of-field/>Depth of Field</a>.</p><p>In practice, we&rsquo;re mostly concerned with comparing lenses by their <a href=/photographer/depth-of-field/>Depth of Field</a>, given that the <a href=/photographer/exposure/>Exposure</a> can be controlled through other means. In this scenario, it&rsquo;s interesting to answer the question: what f-number in a regular camera would provide the same <a href=/photographer/depth-of-field/>Depth of Field</a> as does this lens with this sensor? This is why f-number equivalence as a concept is a thing, even though it can be misleading because it&rsquo;s not really equivalent in every way.</p></body></html>
