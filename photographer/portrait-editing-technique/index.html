If the photo wasn&rsquo;t taken in such way, a good place to start is to mask the background and add a bit of blur. #TODO how?</p><p>Starting with lighting. Portraits usually start with a bright subject, so the idea is to further contrast it with the surroundings. This can be done with a small bump up in <em>Contrast</em> and <em>Highlights</em> plus a notch down on <em>Shadows</em>. This effect can be more dramatic by reducing the <a href=/photographer/exposure/>Exposure</a> of the background and/or increasing it for the subject.</p><p>Moving on to colors, the goal is to emphasize the colors related to the main subject. If the background is neutral, we can just add a good deal of <em>Vibrance</em> to increase color saturation for details. Otherwise, this adjustment can be done just for the subject coupled with a reduction of <em>Saturation</em> for the background. If there&rsquo;s some fashion involved, it&rsquo;s interesting to add a small bump in the <em>Saturation</em> of the most prominent colors for the clothing/make-up as well.</p><p>For effects, adding a good chunk of <em>Vignette</em> will guide the attention to the center of the image. If the subject is a person, reducing <em>Clarity</em> a little bit might smooth out skin imperfections.</p><p>And as final details, an increase in <em>Sharpness</em> will bring crisper edges and balance out any <em>Clarity</em> reduction.</p></body></html>
