However, different sensor sizes will affect the <em>Field of View</em> and <a href=/photographer/depth-of-field/>Depth of Field</a>.</p><p>When comparing a camera with a regular sensor (say a full frame DSLR) and another with with a smaller sensor (say a smartphone), this makes it impossible to define a perfect equivalence between <a href=/photographer/aperture/>Aperture</a> f-numbers. The same number will yield the same exposure but different</p><p>The same can be applied to <a href=/photographer/aperture/>Aperture</a>, as the relationship between sensor size and aperture is very similar to that between focal length and sensor size. It&rsquo;s important to remember that it&rsquo;s <strong>the physical size of the aperture that defines <a href=/photographer/depth-of-field/>Depth of Field</a></strong>, not its f-number. The f-number is the ratio between the <a href=/photographer/focal-length/>Focal Length</a> and the entrance pupil, so smaller cameras will have smaller apertures for the same f-number, and therefore greater <a href=/photographer/depth-of-field/>Depth of Field</a>.</p><p>Equivalence is a way of comparing different sensors on a common basis. This is already the way most lenses are talked about: it&rsquo;s quite common to say that a compact camera includes a &lsquo;28-120mm lens&rsquo; while the key and (often unspoken) word in that description is &rsquo;equivalent.&rsquo; In the digital era, the significance of sensor sizes isn&rsquo;t always appreciated, not helped by a rather opaque naming system.</p><p>A 100 mm <em>equivalent</em> <a href=/photographer/focal-length/>Focal Length</a> on a small-sensor camera will give the same framing and the same perspective as an actual 100mm lens does on a regular full-frame camera.</p><p>This means that f-number alone isn&rsquo;t enough as a descriptor to compare apertures for cameras of different size.</p><p>Two lenses offering the same angle-of-view with 25mm diameter apertures will give the same depth-of-field of shot at the same shooting distance and when viewed at the same output size.</p></body></html>
