Go deep, it&rsquo;s important to reach the base. Go higher slowly until out of the coffee.</p><p>Paper in the bottom of the puck? It reduces the oils, increases flow and yields higher extraction.
It&rsquo;s hard to get by those papers, it&rsquo;s easier to cut actual paper filters. It&rsquo;s very optional, it yields a different profile.</p><p>Puck screens? Thick disks of metal mash that stays on top of the coffee bed. They help distributing the water. It also allegedly prevents the expansion of coffee towards the top. It apparently increases the yield. They&rsquo;re hard to clean, so it&rsquo;s a bit of a nuisance.</p><p>Tamping. It&rsquo;s done before the puck screen, but maybe after too. Make sure the pressure is as vertical as possible. Doesn&rsquo;t have to be infinitely strong, just feel until coffee is not squishy anymore. There are tampers with auto pressure relievers but it&rsquo;s not that valuable.</p></body></html>
