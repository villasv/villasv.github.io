Two burr sets. High uniformity, picked for espresso. Unimodal, (more uniform?) for filter.
Reviews Notes on James Hoffman&rsquo;s Review Quite good filter brews. Even the uniformity burrs are better than default conical burrs. The unimodal burrs would probably better, though, but it adds 200 USD.
RDT is recommended. The portafilter fork is generally fine, designed for 58 mm. Had some issues with the Decent porta filter."><style type=text/css>html{padding-left:calc(100vw - 100%)}body{margin:40px auto;max-width:800px;line-height:1.6;font-size:18px;font-family:inter,Roboto,Arial,sans-serif;color:#444;padding:0 10px;overflow-wrap:break-word}h1,h2,h3{line-height:1.2}p{text-align:justify}img{display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%;height:auto}a,a:visited,a:hover,a:active{color:#0000ae;text-decoration:none}div.highlight pre{overflow:scroll}</style></head><body><ul style=padding-left:0><li style=display:inline><a href=/ style=text-decoration:none>Home</a></li><li style=display:inline><span style=margin-left:5px>></span>

Had some issues with the Decent porta filter.</p><p>It has adjustable RPM, but it just usually sits in the middle.
The grinder is very quiet.
They don&rsquo;t recommend bellows, just a tap on the top is fine.
The distribution in the porta-filter is good, but could use some extra treatment.</p><p>The burrs are great. They&rsquo;re small but it doesn&rsquo;t detracts.
The design and built are great. Looks good, except for the rubber.
It&rsquo;s exceptionally quiet. The workflow is good.</p><p>It&rsquo;s stepless.
The numbers are weird, it goes in the wrong way.
Larger numbers make the grind finer.
The RPM dial numbers are also nonsense and are not really the RPM.
The dosing cup is bulky and out of place.
The porta filter forks tries to be universal, but it fails.</p><p>For the money, there&rsquo;s no better single-dose flat burr grinder.
Is it worth 1000 USD more than a DF64? Personal decision.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeA-IqDEfMw">Full Video</a></p><p>Texture: 8.5
