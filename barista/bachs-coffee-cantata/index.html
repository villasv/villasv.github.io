BWV 211-212 in Apple Music (lyrics)
The work lampoons both the wild popularity of coffee in 18th century Leipzig, as well as the mildly sanctimonious belief held by some of Leipzig society at the time that coffee drinking was a bad habit that needed to be broken."><style type=text/css>html{padding-left:calc(100vw - 100%)}body{margin:40px auto;max-width:800px;line-height:1.6;font-size:18px;font-family:inter,Roboto,Arial,sans-serif;color:#444;padding:0 10px;overflow-wrap:break-word}h1,h2,h3{line-height:1.2}p{text-align:justify}img{display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%;height:auto}a,a:visited,a:hover,a:active{color:#0000ae;text-decoration:none}div.highlight pre{overflow:scroll}</style></head><body><ul style=padding-left:0><li style=display:inline><a href=/ style=text-decoration:none>Home</a></li><li style=display:inline><span style=margin-left:5px>></span>

Bach assumed directorship of the collegium in 1729 and began to perform with the ensemble regularly at Café Zimmerman (Zimmermannsches Kaffeehaus), a coffeehouse and local social centre for gentlemen in Leipzig.</p><p>The story tells of a disgruntled father, Schlendrian, who argues with his caffeine-obsessed daughter, Lieschen, about what he perceives to be her bad habit of indulging in too much coffee. The opera consists mostly of a back-and-forth dialogue between these two characters; bewildered by Lieschen&rsquo;s devotion to the drink, Schlendrian unsuccessfully tries to bribe his daughter into renouncing caffeine while Lieschen evades his commandments with clever maneuvers and outright disobedience.</p></body></html>
