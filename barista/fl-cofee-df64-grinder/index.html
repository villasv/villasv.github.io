Grinding at 5 for Espresso. Around 50-55 for a V60 pour-over.
Reviews Notes on James Hoffman&rsquo;s Review It has a bit of retention due to a cheap silicon de-clumping screen.
There are mods to replace this screen that you can buy out there.
Crazy chaff static if you don&rsquo;t spritz the beans (RDT).
If you grind around 30 g or more, the default cup is more than half full."><style type=text/css>html{padding-left:calc(100vw - 100%)}body{margin:40px auto;max-width:800px;line-height:1.6;font-size:18px;font-family:inter,Roboto,Arial,sans-serif;color:#444;padding:0 10px;overflow-wrap:break-word}h1,h2,h3{line-height:1.2}p{text-align:justify}img{display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%;height:auto}a,a:visited,a:hover,a:active{color:#0000ae;text-decoration:none}div.highlight pre{overflow:scroll}</style></head><body><ul style=padding-left:0><li style=display:inline><a href=/ style=text-decoration:none>Home</a></li><li style=display:inline><span style=margin-left:5px>></span>
