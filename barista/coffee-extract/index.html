They also alter flavor by trapping and later releasing soluble solids and volatiles. The insoluble solids that are <em>in emulsion</em> are primarily made up of cellulose which contributes to body. The oils from the insoluble solids also contribute to aroma and taste, plus it helps to decrease the perception of bitterness by coating the tongue.</p></body></html>
