There are two main plant species of coffee used for consumption: Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Canephora (Coffea canephora). The Canephora species has a most famous varieties named Robusta, commonly used as metonym for the species. Robusta is also known as Conilon in Brazil.
The Canephora species is considered to be an ancestor to the Arabica species, but there&rsquo;s also evidence that the better flavor from Arabica were inherited from the Eugenioides species (Coffea eugenioides)."><style type=text/css>html{padding-left:calc(100vw - 100%)}body{margin:40px auto;max-width:800px;line-height:1.6;font-size:18px;font-family:inter,Roboto,Arial,sans-serif;color:#444;padding:0 10px;overflow-wrap:break-word}h1,h2,h3{line-height:1.2}p{text-align:justify}img{display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%;height:auto}a,a:visited,a:hover,a:active{color:#0000ae;text-decoration:none}div.highlight pre{overflow:scroll}</style></head><body><ul style=padding-left:0><li style=display:inline><a href=/ style=text-decoration:none>Home</a></li><li style=display:inline><span style=margin-left:5px>></span>

The Canephora species has a most famous varieties named Robusta, commonly used as metonym for the species. Robusta is also known as Conilon in Brazil.</p><p>The Canephora species is considered to be an ancestor to the Arabica species, but there&rsquo;s also evidence that the better flavor from Arabica were inherited from the Eugenioides species (<em>Coffea eugenioides</em>). It looks like a single &ldquo;interbreeding&rdquo; event between Canephora and Eugenioides created the common ancestor of all existing Arabica coffee. Eugenioides is a wilder species and much harder to cultivate so it&rsquo;s not widely available.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also a species known as Liberian (<em>Coffea liberica</em>) which accounts for less than 2% the worldwide production, plus other species not widely commercialized like the Racemosa (<em>Coffea racemosa</em>), a low-caffeine species, and the Charrier (<em>Coffea charrieriana</em>), completely caffeine-free, among others.</p><p>There are dozens of Arabica varieties: Benguet, Blue Mountain, Bonifieur, Bourbon, Geisha, Kona, Maracaturra, Maragogipe, Molokai, S795, Sagada etc. Robusta is already a variety of Canephora, and there are a few others like Nganda and Sulu. Liberica has a famous Barako variety. These varieties arise from local selection and also help indicating the beans origin and characteristics.</p><p>Arabica represents around 60% of production and is regarded as the higher quality beans due to extracting with more sugar and less bitterness. Robusta, on the other hand, contains much more caffeine and is less susceptible to pests and diseases so cultivation tends to employ less pesticides. Liberian has the lowest amount of caffeine among the top three and is the most expensive mostly because there&rsquo;s so little produced of it.</p><p>All of the hundreds of commercially available <a href=/sommelier/grape-varieties/>Grape Varieties</a> for wine come from a single species, so it looks like there&rsquo;s still room for a lot of new coffee varieties to emerge!</p></body></html>
