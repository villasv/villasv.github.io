      Who I am as a living person
    </h1>
    <p>
      I like to think of myself as a dilettante hopelessly pursuing a promotion
      to polymath, even though I believe most people would say I'm just a
      specialist with a knack for nosing around and aesthetic overzealousness. I
      take great pleasure from beautiful uses of language and code,
    </p>

      like when antonyms have the same number of letters,<br>
      else many synonyms with all word widths as options,<br>

      What I do with my resources
    </h1>
    <p>
      I spend most of my time in an effort to grok and architect technical
      solutions. I believe technology is my best shot at a good impact because
      there are many low hanging fruits that could be harvested in one fell
      swoop - if only I had an ethical but scalable mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some open source projects I've contributed to include Apache Airflow (and
      its deployment<a href="#2" class="ref">[2]</a>) and educational material
      for Search Engineers<a href="#3" class="ref">[3]</a>.

      Where I belong in this society
    </h1>
    <p>
      I've decided to focus on searching people. Not by name, not by address. By
      who they really are, what they do, where they went and why they might want
      to be found. This is why I joined Gupy<a href="#4" class="ref">[4]</a> in
      a journey to transform other people's journey for personal fulfillment.
