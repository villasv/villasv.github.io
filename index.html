            Who I am as a <strong>living person</strong>
        </h1>
        <p>
            I really like problem solving, and writing is where problem solving
            <em>information</em> meets <em>aesthetics</em>. Great pleasure comes
            from beautiful uses of language and code;

            like when antonyms have the same number of letters,<br>
            even more synonyms with all word widths as options,<br>

        <p>
            Research<a href="#1" class="ref">[1]</a> possible improvements to
            our ability to <em>rank</em> stuff. Human preferences is a very
            complex topic, but even more so is how to optimally adjust to human
            preferences so that we can achieve <em>satisfaction and fairness
            with utility</em>.

        <p>
            Experiment<a href="#2" class="ref">[2]</a> with visual ways to
            represent <em>quality of ordering</em>. Because ranked data
            consumption patterns vary greatly, perception should not be
            abstracted away. Instead, it can become a useful tool to bring
            understanding and improvement.

            Where I belong <strong>in this society</strong>
        </h1>
        <p>I want to solve a problem. I know how to sort things, literally.</p>
        <p>
            Ranking theory is a central topic in Information Retrieval and has a
            wide range of applications. Web search is the most common, but there
            are more specific query scenarios where the result set ordering is
            specially impactful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've decided to focus on searching people. Not by name, not by
            photo. By who they really <em>are</em>, what they've done and where
            they might want to be. This is why I joined Gupy<a href="#4"
            class="ref">[4]</a> in a mission to transform the search for
            professional realization.
