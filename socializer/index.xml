In this case, one way to segue into an affection demonstration with a decreased risk of last-minute second thoughts is to plan ahead an easy start.
For example, for someone that finds hard to initiate with verbal affirmation or physical intimacy, waking up early and making breakfast will get things in motion. The other person will initiate a &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; or a hug that to be corresponded.</description></item><item><title>Corresponding Affection Can Be Hard</title><link>https://victor.villas/socializer/corresponding-affection-can-be-hard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/socializer/corresponding-affection-can-be-hard/</guid><description>Each person might be attuned to demonstrate affection in different ways. For example: verbal affirmation, being present, physical intimacy, gifting, proactive help, respecting space.

Whatever the case, it can be hard to correspond a demonstration of affection in the same manner if it comes through a channel that is a bit underdeveloped on the receiving side.</description></item><item><title>Listen To The Sound Of Silence</title><link>https://victor.villas/socializer/listen-to-the-sound-of-silence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/socializer/listen-to-the-sound-of-silence/</guid><description>An Aphorism conveying the importance of active listening and achieving empathy.
Interpretation Hold talking, keep listening. Give some time for words to be processed into meaning.
Wait for silence, let it be, &amp;ldquo;listen&amp;rdquo; to it (meaning, evaluate it) as much as you were listening to the spoken words before.
What kind of silence is it? Is it a post-rant silence? A help-seeking silence? A comfort-needing silence? Listen to how that silence sounds.</description></item><item><title>Meetup Tracking</title><link>https://victor.villas/socializer/meetup-tracking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://victor.villas/socializer/meetup-tracking/</guid><description>The contact evaluation metric considers three aspects: availability, friendliness, and initiative.

Interpretation Hold questioning, keep listening. Give some space for words to be processed into meaning.
Words are ambiguous because reality is ambiguous. Analyzing it can be useful, but being useful is not always the most important goal.
