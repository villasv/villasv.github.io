Interpretation Hold talking, keep listening. Give some time for words to be processed into meaning.
Wait for silence, let it be, &ldquo;listen&rdquo; to it (meaning, evaluate it) as much as you were listening to the spoken words before.
What kind of silence is it? Is it a post-rant silence? A help-seeking silence? A comfort-needing silence? Listen to how that silence sounds."><style type=text/css>html{padding-left:calc(100vw - 100%)}body{margin:40px auto;max-width:800px;line-height:1.6;font-size:18px;font-family:inter,Roboto,Arial,sans-serif;color:#444;padding:0 10px;overflow-wrap:break-word}h1,h2,h3{line-height:1.2}p{text-align:justify}img{display:block;margin:auto;max-width:100%;height:auto}a,a:visited,a:hover,a:active{color:#0000ae;text-decoration:none}div.highlight pre{overflow:scroll}</style></head><body><ul style=padding-left:0><li style=display:inline><a href=/ style=text-decoration:none>Home</a></li><li style=display:inline><span style=margin-left:5px>></span>

This failure to communicate is not intentional, but ultimately leads to a failure to empathize and convey truthful emotions. The lyrics relate the distancing phenomenon to the modernity of television, which creates isolation.</p></body></html>
