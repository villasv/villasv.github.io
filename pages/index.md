# Who I am as a living person

Victor Villas is a thinker, writer and speaker - preferably in this order. He
has had some success at listening, but nothing remarkable so far. He reads,
never sings, maybe dances, swims better than runs. Cooking is on the roadmap.

Less frequently than he could, publishes a new essay[[1]](#1). More frequently
than he should, gibbers on social media[[2]](#2)

# When can we have a chat?

If you're a letter person (or a very literal person, but one who likes to write
letters), you can reach me out with an e-[mail](mailto:mail@victor.villas).
