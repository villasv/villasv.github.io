The original question was "What should I do?", but despite being general, it
doesn't _feel_ general. It feels helpless, maybe because it's something helpless
people say very frequently. As it turns out though, everyone is always asking
the same question - the only help was narrowing the scope you can explore for an
answer. I'll argue that this is not really helping.

## Work, Jobs, Career, Profession

There are people

## Purpose, Meaning, Mission, Reason

_Raison d'Ãªtre_

## Investing, Saving, Spending,


## Hedonism and Existentialism

I take great pleasure from beautiful uses of language and code,

```
like when antonyms have the same number of letters,
else many synonyms with all word widths as options,
fine gift allowing code and poem rivers to trickle;
```

or other ways in which poetry creeps into formal settings[[1]](#1). This is very
entertaining, so I spend quite a piece of the day reading and writing such work.
