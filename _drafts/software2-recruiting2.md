title:  "Recruiting 2.0 comes from Software 2.0"
---

When discussing with my friend (and Product Owner in charge) Natália Turrioni,
one thing became clear about HR metrics: it's hard to pinpoint a metric that
should *always* increase. This is a bit frustrating because many experiments end
up with inconclusive results and tentative ad-hoc interpretations.

# Introduction

Let's say we want to make hiring faster and efficient. We can try to decrease
positions time-to-close. But then we may end up hiring "badly" and increase
turnover. Let's try to decrease time-to-close and turnover. We may end up
decreasing average performance, employee satisfaction, cultural fitness, and
this game goes on.

Every time we try to define a goal, we get a different corner case that comes
from the multidimensional facets of what makes a hire a good hire *good*. And
that definition is not even pervasive; some niches have a healthy turnover, some
have unusual performance baselines, some may not even know what a good hire is.

# Single Responsibility Principle

I once attended a talk on "hiring with diversity". At the end, someone made
(approximately) this question:

> I do my best to present the managers with a diverse pool of people to
> interview, but they still take the final decision. And that final decision is
> usually male. What can I do?

The (approximate) answer from the presenter:

> As a recruiter, nothing. You did your best, you did your part. It's above your
> paygrade to confront that manager. It's someone else's job to show real
> evidence (and we know there's plenty out there to be found) that there's
> business value on hiring more diversely, maybe someone from a people analytics
> team or someone with that specific project with the endorsement of the Head of
> HR. As a human being, however, you can always attempt put in motion stuff
> above your paygrade. That also one way to make the paygrade climb.

One takeaway is this notion of decision boundaries. Fairness during resumé
screening is not enough, but it's a necessary building block. If we manage to
isolate the recruiter role in the hiring process
