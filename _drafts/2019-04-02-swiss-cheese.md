The Swiss Cheese "paradox" is an old "joke" that I've known since the 90's. It's
not a real paradox, and aguably not a joke either, but serves as an interesting
starting point to thignk about throughput on selection processes.

# The Swiss Cheese dynamics

> Consider the Swiss Cheese:

Explaining a joke is no fun, but it's important this time. It's true that the
more *holes per volume* of cheese, the less *mass per volume* of cheese you
have. It's also true that the more *volume* of cheese, the more holes. But the
more *volume* of cheese, *holes per volume* remains constant and we can't say we
have less *mass* of cheese.

In recruiting, we have a similar Swiss Cheese dynamic concerning the talent pool
available for a given job position and the occurrence of mismatches (I tend not
to call them "unfit candidates" as it may very well be that the job is the thing
unfit for the person).

> Consider a talent pool:
>
> The more mismatches, the less interviews.
>
> The more applicants, the more mismatches.
>
> The more applicants, the less interviews.

Again, the trick is to recognize that we're at first talking about density but
then shifting the point of view to deal with absolute numbers. It's true that a
pool with a bigger *proportion* of mismatches yields a smaller *proportion* of
interviews, but more applicants means more mismatches AND more interviews...

or not?

# The size of a cheese platter

Let's say you have 1 open position and you have 10 applicants. It's feasible to
interview them all, so you will 100% surely have the opportunity to pinpoint the
best match for the job.

Now let's imagine you have 100 applicants, and your small-sized HR team can only
affort to interview 10 of them until the hiring deadline. This means only 10% of
them will have a real chance, and randomly selecting 10 applicants will give you
a 10% chance of interviewing the best match.

If you have 1000 applicants, however, you'll interview 1% of them, so randomly
selecting 10 applicants will give a 1% chance of finding the the best match.
This means that if you want to keep the odds of success high, you'll need to
interview more!

Nope.

Should you really measure success with focus on the "best" candidate? Can you
even objectively define what "best" means, having that much diversity in a
talent pool? In 10 applicants, one expects the difference between "the best" and
"the second best" to be **maybe** noticeable, but in 10000 applicants there
ought to be a handful of candidates that would match equally well.

This means that selectiveness doesn't have to be different: the match/mismatch
ratio should still stay the same, just like the cheese/hole density as you get
more Swiss Cheese in the platter. Considering a random selection, the expected
matching of the interviewed candidates is the average matching of whole pool.
Given equal mismatch-dense talent pools, more positions means more interviews
but more applicants means nothing.

So should we interview more or less candidates when we have a bigger pool?
Neither. The decision to interview more should depend only on the expected
quality of the talent pool - which is the end result of an attraction campaign.

# Smelling is a form of tasting

The previous argument was made regarding a totally random selection for
interviews. Random sampling is the norm for a surprisingly large amount of
companies, where recruiters observe candidates in an order without much meaning
like application dates or candidate names and other usual sorting criteria on
"analogic" processes.

In truth, candidates are randomly selected but there's still the decision making
process of passing that candidate forward into an interview or not. But assuming
constant precision on this decision process, the previous conclusion still
holds: the expected matching depends only on the average matching of the pool,
so more applicants should not mean either more or less interviews being made.

Think of if this way: resumÃ© screening is just a cheap form of interview, where
the candidate can only communicate through an immutable set of words on a paper.
Phone screening, face to face interviews, whiteboard interviews and even job
rotation periods are just variations of more expensive but (maybe?) more
effective assessments.

For simplicity's sake and not to confuse with assessments like english or IQ
tests, I'll keep referring to recruiter-driven assessments as "interviews" to
make the distinction that they involve human interaction - the expensive and not
scalable ingredient. We're interested on the relationship between the size of
the talent pool and the interview effort, no matter the type of interview.

Of course, the real world is a messy place and if we try hard enough we can find
examples of things that are not quite a test nor an interview. If we allow our
definitions to meet in the middle, we can describe the selection process
entirely: every step is an assessment in the spectrum between a standardized
test and an unstructured interview.

# The top high Calcium cheese

Interviews are valuable because they're adaptable and exploratory, but tests
have an important advantage: they produce comparable output. The ability to
objectively compare candidates in a fair and scalable way is the basis for a
change in the economics of recruiting:

> Tests enable us way to **rank** applicants

This is empowering if the test results are easily processed, something that has
been enabled by the digital transformation in HR. If we have a ranking system,
our selection is no longer a random sampling. Assuming that some test is very
appropriate for a job position, we should find matches easier if we focus our
attention on the top scorers.
