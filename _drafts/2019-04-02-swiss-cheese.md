The Swiss Cheese "paradox" is an old "joke" that I've known since the 90's. It's
not a real paradox, and aguably not a joke either, but serves as an interesting
starting point to thignk about throughput on selection processes.

# The Swiss Cheese dynamics

Explaining a joke is no fun, but it's important this time. It's true that the
more *holes per volume* of cheese, the less *mass per volume* of cheese you
have. It's also true that the more *volume* of cheese, the more holes. But the
more *volume* of cheese, *holes per volume* remains constant and we can't say we
have less *mass* of cheese.

In recruiting, we have a similar Swiss Cheese dynamic concerning the talent pool
available for a given job position and the occurrence of mismatches (I tend not
to call them "unfit candidates" as it may very well be that the job is the thing
unfit for the person).

> Consider a talent pool:
>
> The more mismatches, the less interviews.
>
> The more applicants, the more mismatches.
>
> The more applicants, the less interviews.

Again, the trick is to recognize that we're at first talking about density but
then shifting the point of view to deal with absolute numbers. It's true that if
we have more applicants, we'll have more mismatches. But we'll have less
interviews only if we have a bigger *proportion* of mismatches.

# The size of a cheese platter

Let's say you have 1 open position and you might want to interview 10
candidates. If you have 20 applicants, you'll interview 50% of them. Even
randomly selecting 10 applicants will give you a 50% chance of interviewing the
best match.

If you have 1000 applicants, however, you'll interview 1% of them, so randomly
selecting 10 applicants will give a 1% chance of finding the the best match.
This means that if you want to keep the odds of success high, you'll need to
interview more.

Or does it not?

Should you really measure success with focus on the "best" candidate? Can you
even objectively define what "best" means, having that much diversity in a
talent pool? In 20 applicants, one expects the difference between "the best" and
"the second best" to be **maybe** noticeable, but in 10000 applicants there
ought to be a handful of candidates that would match equally well.

This means that selectiveness doesn't have to be different: the match/mismatch
ratio should still stay the same, just like the cheese/hole density as you get
more Swiss Cheese in the platter. Considering a random selection, the expected
matching of the interviewed candidates is the average matching of whole pool.
Given equally good talent pools, more positions means more interviews but more
applicants means nothing.

So should we interview more or less candidates when we have a bigger pool?
Neither. The decision to interview more should depend only on the expected
quality of the talent pool - which is the end result of an attraction campaign.

# Bite-sized for all bite sizes

The previous argument was made regarding a totally random selection for
interviews. Random sampling is the norm for a surprisingly large amount of
companies, where recruiters observe candidates in an order without much meaning
like application dates or candidate names and other usual sorting criteria on
"analogic" processes.

In truth, candidates are randomly selected but there's still the decision making
process of passing that candidate forward into an interview or not. But assuming
constant precision on this decision process, the previous conclusion still
holds: the expected matching depends only on the average matching of the pool,
so more applicants should not mean either more or less interviews being made.

Think of if this way: resumé screening is just a cheap form of interview, where
the candidate can only communicate through an immutable set of words on a paper.
Phone screening, face to face interviews, whiteboard interviews and even job
rotation periods are just variations of more expensive but (maybe?) more
effective assessments.

For simplicity's sake and not to confuse with online assessments like english or
IQ tests, I'll keep referring to the former as "interviews" to make the
distinction that they involve human interaction - the expensive ingredient.
We're interested on the relationship of the size of the talent pool and the
interview effort, no matter the definition of an interview.

# Lab results came in, it's dairy

What is the role of online assessment in this context? It has two main important
aspects in our current analysis:

1. It augments the resumé with standardized information
2. It provides a way to **rank** applicants automatically

The first point is essential because standardization is key to fairness and
scalability.

The second point is relevant because if we have a ranking system, our selection
is no longer a random sampling. Assuming that some test is very appropriate for
a job position, we'll almost certainly find matches easier if we focus our
attention on the top scorers of the test.

Again, the types of test, how many tests and so on are important decisions in
the real world but irrelevant for the current analysis. We can consider every
assessment that does not involve human interaction a kind of test, even complex
heuristics that measure text similarity between resumé and job description.
