It plays a major role on the final flavor profile of the\n\\[\\[Coffee Extract\\]\\], as though beans will naturally have their\ndifferent characteristics, their chemical composition is dramatically\naffected by the roasting process (pyrolysis).\n\nFor example, roasting affects the solubility of carbohydrates. Increased\ndegrees of roasting increase the solubility of galactomannans, but too\nmuch roasting leads to degradation of arabinogalactans. These two are\nthe main polysaccharides present in a coffee brew and are theorized to\ndefine the brew \\[\\[Sweetness\\]\\]. Sugar compounds like sucrose don\\'t\nsurvive even the lightest roasts.\n\nMore roasting also means less acidity.\n\nToo little roasting means less aroma because the gas is not created, so\nless aroma.\n\nToo much roasting rips the cellulose containing the formed gases and\nthese are lost, so less aroma.\n\nSame thing with body. Too little roasting, little body. Too much\nroasting, little body.\n\nToo much roasting pretty much destroys everything and leaves only\nbitterness.[Â ]{.Apple-converted-space}\n\n#TODO Maillard reaction/components\n\n#TODO\nhttps://associatedcoffee.com/blog/how-coffee-changes-during-the-roasting-process/\n\n#TODO https://codeblackcoffee.com.au/blogs/coffee-notes/coffee-module-1\n\nHowever, the darker the roast doesn't mean the better the brew as this\nis a common misconception. The beans should be roasted to a point where\nthe preferred flavor profiles are highlighted and this generally happens\nbetween in a light to medium roast.\n\nPitch-black coffee roasted is usually an indicative of low-quality\nbeans, as the roasting process had no intent of preserving flavor.\n\n### \\## Window\n\n### \\## Freshness\n\nThe life expectancy of roasted coffee can be anywhere from 2 weeks to 2\nmonths from the roast date, after which the beans starts to go stale and\nthere\\'s noticeable deterioration in quality, usually in the form of\nsour, dull/flat flavors.\n\nThe expectancy varies across roast profile and storage (oxygen, light,\nmoisture, extreme temperature). Darker roasts release CO2 faster and\nstale quicker due to the weakening of the beans cellulose structures.\nOxygen and light cause oxidation, while moisture might react with the\ngrounds and extreme temperatures will break down important components.\n"}}]}]
