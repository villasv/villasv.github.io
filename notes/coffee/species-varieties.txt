The\nCanephora species has a most famous variety named Robusta, commonly used\nas metonym for the species. Robusta is also known as Conilon in Brazil.\n\nThe Canephora species is considered to be an ancestor to the Arabica\nspecies, but there\\'s also evidence that the better flavor from Arabica\nwas inherited from the Eugenioides species (*\\_Coffea eugenioides\\_*).\nIt is believed that a single \\\"interbreeding\\\" event between Canephora\nand Eugenioides created the common ancestor of all existing Arabica\ncoffee. Eugenioides is a wilder species and much harder to cultivate so\nit\\'s not widely available.\n\nThere\\'s also a species known as Liberian (*\\_Coffea liberica\\_*) which\naccounts for less than 2% the worldwide production, plus other species\nnot significantly commercialized like the Racemosa (*\\_Coffea\nracemosa\\_*), a low-caffeine species, and the Charrier (*\\_Coffea\ncharrieriana\\_*), completely caffeine-free, among others.\n\nThere are \\[dozens of Arabica\nvarieties\\]([https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/varieties]{.s1}).\nA few notable ones are the Typica (considered the first and grown\nextensively around the world), Bourbon (mutation of Typica with\ndistinctive sweetness), Caturra (mutation of Bourbon that is high yield\nand low growing), Mundo Novo (hybrid of Typica and Bourbon with strength\nand disease resistance),[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}Catuaí (hybrid of\nCaturra and Mundo Novo combining low growing and strength), Geisha\n(exceptionally floral aromatics).\n\nRobusta is already a variety of Canephora, but there are a few others\nnotable ones like Nganda and Sulu. Liberian has a famous Barako variety.\nThese varieties arise from local selection and help indicating the beans\norigin and characteristics.\n\nArabica represents around 60% of production and is regarded as the\nhigher quality beans due to extracting with more sweetness and less\nbitterness. Canephora, on the other hand, contains much more caffeine\nand is less susceptible to pests and diseases so cultivation tends to\nemploy less pesticides. Liberian has the lowest amount of caffeine among\nthe top three and is the most expensive mostly because there\\'s so\nlittle produced of it.\n\nAll of the hundreds of commercially available \\[\\[Grape Varieties\\]\\]\nfor wine come from a single species, so there\\'s still room for a many\nmore new coffee varieties to emerge.\n"}}]}]
