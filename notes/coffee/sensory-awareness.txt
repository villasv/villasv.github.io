Although the sensory exploration of coffee is usually called\n*tasting*, it\\'s about flavors and it can also impacted by hearing and\nsight.\n\nThe Basic Tastes\n\nThe tongue has taste buds all over and each taste bud can detect all\nbasic tastes, albeit with different intensities. Also know as palates,\nthese taste buds are the ones responsible for translating the chemistry\nin the mouth as a sensory signal.\n\nSweet\n\nWe crave sweetness from carbohydrates, mostly simple sugars, as these\nare essential energy sources. In coffee it comes from the fruit and\nbrowning reaction during roasting.\n\nSour\n\nMostly perceived from acids and causes us to salivate, releasing\nbicarbonates to neutralize it. Too much acidity is unpleasant and could\nsignal rotten or unripe food.\n\nSalty\n\nWe're geared to detect sodium as it's critical for fluid control and\nchemical pathways. Differently from sweet and sour tastes, it can\nenhance other flavors.\n\nBitter**[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}**\n\nWe are relatively resistant to bitterness compared to the other tastes.\nLike acidity, in high intensity is considered a chemical danger signal\nand therefore unpleasant.\n\nUmami\n\nSometimes confused with the salty taste, it's associated with high\nprotein content. Described as \"savory\", unlike the salty taste there's\nno ceiling where it becomes unpleasant.\n\nPalate Training\n\n  ----------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------- ---------\n  Taste                               Chemistry[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}              Recipe\n  Sweet                               Sucrose                                           6 g/l\n  Sour                                Citric Acid                                       0.6 g/l\n  Salty                               Sodium Chloride                                   1.2 g/l\n  Bitter[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}   Quinine                                           0.7 g/l\n  Umami                               Monosodium Glutamate[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}   0.6 g/l\n  ----------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------- ---------\n\n## Smell\n\nThe majority of the information we can perceive in flavours actually\ncomes from the sense of smell. Most people can relate to how flavourless\nmeals seem when sick with a running nose, and it\\'s easy to observe\nexperimentally: a bit of cinnamon in the mouth while pitching the nose\nreveals that it provides almost no taste.\n\n## Touch\n\nThe tongue is among the most sensitive parts of the body regarding\ntouch. Just like one can use their hands to describe shape, weight and\ntexture; the tongue can perceive the same characteristics in the\nexperience of *mouthfeel*.\n\n## Palate Training\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 1.  1\\) Prepare a glass of full-fat milk and 0%mf milk                |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 2\\) Taste both milks paying attention to all the differences between  |\n| them                                                                  |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 3\\) Examine the texture (creaminess that coats the tongue): creamy vs |\n| thin                                                                  |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 4\\) Examine the shape (???): round vs flat                            |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 5\\) Examine the weight (): heavy vs light                             |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| 6\\) Examine the sensation (): smooth vs flabby                        |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n### \\## Pour Over Salami\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgYNCTiZKQs&t=473s\n\n1\\. Bloom with 25g\n\n2\\. Pour 75g\n\nFirst stage of extraction. Dissolving the easiest materials. Acids and\nsalts.\n\nIt\\'s thick, heavy. Where most of the extraction happens.\n\nThick, dark, aroma. Fidelity on fruity notes, but the salts and acids\ngive a tart and unripe feel.\n\nA smooth but sour cup.\n\n2\\. Pour 75g\n\n\\~0:50s\n\nSecond stage. Simple and complex sugars. Sweetness.\n\nSweeter but without texture or clarity. Water with cane sugar. Still\nsalty but very little acidity.\n\n2\\. Pour 75g\n\n\\~1:45\n\nFinal stage. Lighter color because most solubles are already gone. This\nis more watery.\n\nThis is what happens if you brew for too long: watery and bitterness.\n\nMuch lighter, almost no aroma, no acidity and little sweetness. Dry and\nbitter.\n\nFlorals, coconut etc are bitter elements and will extract here so we\ndon\\'t want to get rid of it.\n\nThe goal is to determine how to change grind size to brew longer or\nshorter to control which extraction profile to reach on the brew to get\na balanced cup. One usually wants the most sugars with enough bitter\nelements to complement the acidity. If you brew too short, the cup lacks\nin bitterness and the fruity notes become sour unripe. If you brew too\nlong, fruity notes becomes mute with bitterness. This is the dialing of\nextraction.\n\n### \\## Sugar and Sweetness\n\nSweetness is a basic taste most commonly perceived when eating foods\nrich in certain substances (usually carbohydrates) called sugars. Simple\nsugars (monosaccharides) include glucose, fructose, and galactose.\nCompound sugars (disaccharides) are molecules made of two bonded\nmonosaccharides; common examples are sucrose (glucose + fructose),\nlactose (glucose + galactose), and maltose (two molecules of glucose).\nChains of monosaccharides longer than two are not regarded as sugars and\nare called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides.\n\n### \\## Saccharides in Coffee\n\nCoffee is often described in terms of sweetness and is common to see\ntasters describe a brew as \\\"sweet\\\" during \\[\\[Cupping\\]\\], but it\\'s\nstill not fully understood what chemical compound exactly we are\ndetecting as sweet. Coffee beans do contain sucrose, but the roasting\nprocess degrades about 97% of it. The amount of sucrose that ends up in\nthe brew is so low that it\\'s below the sensory threshold concentration,\nmeaning it is impossible for us to perceive it.\n\nThere are some carbohydrates - arabinogalactans - that are usually\npresent in the brew in high enough concentrations and maybe can be\nperceived as sweet, but their influence in the brew sweetness is still\nan hypothesis.\n\nIt\\'s also possible that the sweet flavor we sense actually comes from\nsweet aromas instead of from compounds on our taste buds.\n"}}]}]
