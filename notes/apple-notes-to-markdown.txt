It brings one major\nlimitation that many in the technology community consider a dealbreaker:\nit's locked in. Apple Notes does not support file-based access and it\noffers no simple methods of exposing notes publicly on the Web.\n\n## Objective\n\nDesign an automated system that exports Notes as Markdown once a day,\nwithout availability guarantees but easy to backfill.\n\n## Tenants\n\n1.  Keep it simple with on-device MacOS tools\\\n    There's no need to invest in operational excellence given the\n    relaxed availability goals. Apple Notes does not provide any other\n    public APIs and unofficial tools bring security concerns.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### \\[1\\] Pure Shortcuts\n\n1.  Portable to any device with Shortcuts\n2.  Easier to share and onboard with wider audience\n\n### \\[2\\] Shell Script + 3rd party tools\n\n1.  **Faster to compose, maintain and expand**\n2.  Native automation mechanism (cron) on MacOS\n3.  Easier to collaborate and attract contributions\n4.  **Richer ecosystem of tools**\n\nA pure Shortcuts solution would be an interesting achievement and\npositively impact more people, but a pragmatic analysis heavily favours\nusing tooling that is both more capable and easier to compose - for\nsomeone who already knows shell scripting.\n\n## Challenges\n\n### \\[1\\] Native Shortcuts export of Notes to RTF or Markdown is lossy\n\nExporting Notes to RTF or Markdown does not preserve structural\ninformation regarding titles, headers and sub-headers. The most\ninformation-complete format to export is HTML, which translates the\nwhole document using p tags but at least marks titles and headers with\nspecific CSS classes. Subheaders are indistinguishable from[Â \n]{.Apple-converted-space}paragraphs in bold.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Cron\n\n0 \\* \\* \\* \\* notes2md \\>/tmp/stdout.log 2\\>/tmp/stderr.log\n\n### Script\n\n<https://github.com/villasv/villasv.github.io/blob/main/scripts/notes2md>\n"}}]}]
