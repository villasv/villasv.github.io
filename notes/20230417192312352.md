## PESOS: from Device to GitHub

The same shortcut that creates the Note also goes on to create the
Issue, but if for whatever reason the issue creation fails (e.g. no
Internet), there\'s an Anti-Entropy shortcut that regularly checks for
the need of syndicate that Note.

TODO: show the Place Check-In shortcut

GitHub Issues works both as a long-term replicated database of those
check-ins and as a queue for the next step of the syndication pipeline.
A GitHub Action on a schedule is responsible for parsing the information
on open issues to generate YAML files that are commited to the
repository.

## Consistency

In the end, there are three databases to keep synchronized: Apple Notes,
GitHub Issues, Flat Files.
