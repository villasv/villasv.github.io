# Reclaiming the Web

The web is a cool place. We have many platforms, social networks, never-ending
content, independent websites; and most of it was built on technology intended
to be decentralized and democratic, which greatly contributed to the diversity
of services and organizations participating.

Alas, commit long enough to an booming ecosystem and it's inevitable to witness
frustrating limitations and wasted potential. It's possible to share a Goodreads
book review on social media, but comments/replies won't be visible in Goodreads.
Facebook algorithmic feeds penalizes links to external websites. Instagram
outright disallowed links in posts. Twitter closed off its API. Spotify tried
podcast exclusives. Each service welcomes more content, but is resistant to let
users get it elsewhere.

That's because recent developments on the web haven't always followed the same
principles of openness and user empowerment. Corporations behind big platforms
are financially incentivized to silo themselves, cut off the competition and
constrain even the users who supposedly own the content they produce. The data
they collect is how they are able to grow engagement for their ads and service
businesses, so strong regulation is generally the only reason why a silo would
open up.

But policy making is slow and overloaded with tough decisions, having to react
to an ever changing technology landscape and fight against the interest of the
biggest corporations in the world. Action is needed right now, and the
independent web is a grassroots movement to nudge the web back into a more
decentralized but interconnected place.

## Owning a Domain Name

Having an own personal Internet Domain Name is the first step towards building
an identity and assuming control over a corner of the Web. Because the domain
serves as a foundation to an online identity, it should be chosen carefully and
considered permanent as much as possible. A domain costs money, but a cheap one
costs less than a telephone landline.

There are a few tools like [CunningBot][] that can help choosing a domain name
and others like [Instant Domain Search][] that can quickly search under which
TLDs a name is available. There are also tools like [Namechk][] that probe if
common platforms and social networks will have that name as an available
handles, which is nice for consistency.

## Custom Email Address

If a purchasing a domain name is like buying a virtual lot of land with a proper
address, configuring an email inbox would be the equivalent of installing a mail
box able to receive the usual proofs of residency.

Most e-mail providers support adding a custom email address to an existing
account, requiring minimal work to start using the new address and keeping all
the old mail. If the current provider doesn't support it, it's likely the Domain
Registrar that sells the domain will offer an inbox or forwarding service.

Having all e-mail coming through an own address allows changing providers in the
future without the hassle of notifying contacts and updating credentials. Just
point the address to a different mailbox and start receiving new mail there.
Reducing lock-in to specific platforms is a simple yet effective way to diminish
their backing corporations' hold on the ecosystem.

## A Personal Website

Owning a domain and being reachable through it (e.g. with a custom email) is the
foundation for an independent presence on the Web, but the real potential lies
in using that property to build up a haven for what matters. That's possible
going back to the open technologies behind the success of the Internet: web
pages.

There are many ways to create and operate a website: from all-inclusive builders
like WordPress, to online hosting a Static Website, to self-hosting a
fully-fledged web server.

A cheap way to operate a website is to use static website hosting, which is
often offered freely by several platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Netlify,
CloudFlare, DigitalOcean and many others. In any case, you're responsible for
configuring the website generation with a static website generator tool and the
website publishing with one of these platforms.
