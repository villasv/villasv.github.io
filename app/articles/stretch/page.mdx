# ðŸ§ž Arcane & Blursed StretchText

The web is built on HyperText Markup Language (HTML), [proposed in 1990][html]
as a way to solve an inherent problem with vast bodies of writing: referencing
and creating links to other content.

The technology on HyperText has come a long way. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
was [proposed in 1994][css] bringing versatility to layout and visual aspects of
HyperText documents; and [in 1995 JavaScript came along][js] to enable dynamic
documents and complex behavior.

[js]: https://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/https://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html

It didn't take two decades before these technologies would grow nearly
limitless. Tools like [D3][] showcase the flexibility of the definition of what
a "document" is, using HyperText blocks with styling and behavior to enable
amazingly complex data visualization.

Yet most medium-to-long-form writing (like this one) is still mostly confined to
print media presentation and structure, except for the occasional embedded audio
or video. This seemingly staleness is not due to the lack of creativity. The
person who coined the term "hypertext" had already [proposed StretchText in
1967][stretchtext].

StretchText is an interesting and immediately appealing idea: text that can be
expanded into more details if and only if the reader has interest on it.
[It][st1] [keeps][st2] [getting][st3] [rediscovered][st4], though never making
it into wide adoption. Most people never heard of it and those who did have a
hard time recalling it being used in more than 3 places.

[st4]: https://web.archive.org/web/20220817154515/https://ncase.me/nutshell/

Why is that? Such an intriguing and powerful idea with so little traction. There
ought to be some reason to it. After [trying to use it myself][life], I think I
can extrapolate from my own reasoning as to why I'm probably not going to write
much more stretchtext either.

## Increased effort

When using stretchtext one doesn't have to concern themselves with the task of
reducing the overall scope to target a specific audience, as each level of
interest and expertise will self guide - in theory - to the appropriate level of
detail.

In practice, that means writing for multiple possible audiences at the same time
and planning ahead how to weave those two (three, four...) texts into a single
current of ideas. Instead of deciding whether to add a foot note (don't!), a
separate paragraph, or link to a separate document; there's now another set of
choices to be made at every turn.

Doesn't sound too hard, but stretching words into expanded forms within parent
sentences requires writing similar to poetry. If stretching whole sentences to
more sentences, there's still some effort in keeping harmony with the paragraph.
This level of orchestration isn't expected from other forms of linked content
and highly increases the rewriting and rewording loop.

Rhymes are lovely, but it's also hard to do at the same time an argument is to
be made or an opinion is to be explained. It requires a lot of effort and it's
most often not contributing to the main goal of the writeup.

## Marginal gains

Even if a reader is already optimally served by the current level of detail,
they will expand deeper _just to be sure_. The reader cannot tell what is their
ideal level of detail until they shoot past it, as there's usually no means of
previewing the collapsed content. Going further, it's likely that most readers
will expand the vast majority of collapsed content simply out of curiosity (or
[FOMO][]) anyway.

[FOMO]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out

Readers that would read the whole text can run out of patience for clicking and
re-reading; and readers that would have benefited from the terser form will
repeatedly experience the regret of unnecessary expansions before they learn to
live with the anxiety of not knowing what's behind the curtain.

That's probably why many platforms offer page previews on mouse hover instead of
stretchable embedded content: preview is cheap and ephemeral. The reader doesn't
feel pressured to read or follow a link just because they hovered over it.
Navigating to a different document is a clear context switch and the reader
expects the current document to be self-contained.

# Future as Fringe Technique

Given the big costs and difficulty of positive returns, the application of
StretchText is probably destined to remain rare. Its alternatives like
hyperlinks and conceptual successors like hovering commentary tooltips will
remain the preferred choices for tucking away additional content.

It also remains true that StretchText is _enticing_. It's more interactive,
exercises curiosity, it's _different_. Because it's so difficult to get it
right, when it clicks it's amazing. Used sparingly, intentionally and with a
great deal of sense of art, it will keep getting rediscovered now and then as an
exotic spice for hypertext. Arcane magic theorized before the web itself, a will
of the ancients.
