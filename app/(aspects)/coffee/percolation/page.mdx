# Percolation Brewing

## Bloom

The main goal of blooming is to degass the coffee. The bubbling up of CO2
insulates solubles (decreasing yield) and contributes to channeling (decreasing
uniformity of extraction). The blooming pour doesn't need to prioritize high
yields as to not release aromatics too early, so [some professionals][SamoBloom]
advocate for a cooler bloom.

## Bypass

It's when water goes around the beans, instead of through. The higher the water level relative to the coffee bed, the more bypass in a regular filter.

No-Bypass Filters
It's a concept around pour-over coffee.

Some of the water goes side-ways in the filter and around the coffee.
That water is called bypass water.

The more water goes through coffee, the more solubles down the cup.
Less bypass means more effective and efficient extraction.
A stronger extraction.

Aeropress is zero-bypass, espresso as well.
But water doesn't want to go through coffee, it takes pressure.

## Recipes

### Matt Winton's Five Pours ~ James Hoffman's Single Cup V60

A simple 5-pour recipe for medium-coarse grinds that makes use of high
agitation. Popularized by Matt Winston ([MW1][], [MW2]) and recommended for
single-cup brews by James Hoffman ([JH1][]).

- 15 g of coffee
- 250 g of water
- Medium-fine grind, aiming at a 3m total drawdown

1. Bloom with 50 g of water, swirl and rest until 1:00
2. Pour another 50 g, rest until 1:00
3. Pour another 50 g, rest until 1:20
4. Pour another 50 g, rest until 1:40
5. Pour the remaining 50 g and swirl

### Lance Hedrick's Vibrant V60

A recipe that prioritizes vibrancy and fruity notes instead of clarity and high
extractions. According to [Lance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAdgJNK0csc),
it's also forgiving of conical burrs because it aims to capture fines on the
sides of the filter through controlled agitation.

- Boiling water
- 1:17 ratio (e.g. 18 g coffee, 306 g of water)
- Grind size of 5.5 on the K-Plus
- Rinse filter with strong tap stream to minimize air pockets
- Loose divot in the center

1. Bloom with 3x dose doing a spiral from higher up (2 minutes rest)
2. Swirl aggressively ensuring no clumps on the walls
3. Pour doing a spiral from higher up up to 1/3 of the total brew
4. Pour the remaining 2/3 in a spiral down closer
5. Gently stir the upper layer of the liquid until it finishes draining

### Kissaten Coffee Dome - 喫茶店 コーヒードーム

An unnamed and very pretty technique traditional in Japanese coffee shops,
divulged by [Brewing Habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqQDYf8BmIA).
Sometimes called Osmotic Flow by [CAFEC](https://cafec-jp.com/brewing-guide/)'s
marketing, though the science justifying that name is controversial.

- Minimum 18 g coffee dose, darker roasts preferred
- 1:13 to 1:16 ratio, traditionally closer to 1:13
- 80-85 °C water is enough for such high dose and darker roast
- Minimize stirring by pouring very slowly and very close (about 1 cm high)
- Grind size about a bit coarser than a normal V60 grind to speed up flow
- Rinse/pre-heat filter & shake coffee grinds flat beforehand

1. Bloom with 2-3 x dose in slow spirals (10-30 seconds rest)
2. Pour at the center **up to** 1/3 of the total brew (let it drain for 5 seconds)
3. Pour the remaining 2/3 in a slow spiral up to a ~2.5 cm diameter
4. Let it drain only for 5 seconds, then remove brewer
