# Long Grain White Rice

The type of rice depends on the degree of processing dealing with its multiple
layers: brown rice includes the bran, germ, and endosperm - the bran and germ
are nutrient rich, but have tougher texture and a characteristic earthy color;
white rice is generally just the endosperm - the chaff, bran, and germ removed -
pretty much just the starch part of the whole grain.

## Doneness: Gelatinization vs Pasting

Rice being mostly starch, is composed of semi crystalline granules. If exposed
to enough heat and moisture, these starch granules swell and soften, loosening
that hard, crystalline structure, a process known as **gelatinization**. When
rice is fully gelatinized, it is soft and palatable; otherwise it feels crunchy
(undercooked).

After gelatinization, continued heating or agitation begins to break down those
swollen starch granules, leaching amylose and increasing the viscosity of the
surrounding liquid. This process known as pasting results in sticky and mushy
rice (overcooked).

## Washing Out Some Amylopectin

Rice contains two main types of starch: amylose and amylopectin, both large
polycarbohydrates that store glucose. Amylose is less soluble in water than
Amylopectin, therefore the latter contributes more to the pasting effect. Rice
grain varieties that are relatively high in amylose tend to be more separate
when cooked, with less sticking between grains, while rice with a higher
relative amylopectin content tends to produce stickier rice with less separation
between grains.
