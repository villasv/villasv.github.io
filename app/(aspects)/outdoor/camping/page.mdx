### Notes on Bikes & Transit

Nearly every TransLink bus will have two bike racks. West Coast Express allows
two bikes per car. On SkyTrain: Canada Line limits one bike per car; Millennium
Line and Expo Line allow two bikes per car, but not during rush hours (weekdays
westbound 07:00-09:00, eastbound 16:00-18:00). SeaBus has a limit of 6 bikes
during rush hours (07:00-09:30 & 15:00-18:30). The Summer Bike Bus fits 10
bikes.

#TODO: research bikes & transit on the island, S·∏µwxÃ±w√∫7mesh and Whistler.

kettle. The fort has flush toilets and WiFi but no showers. There are barbecue
stoves in a shared area and each cabin has a propane stove. Alcohol permitted

[sidney-spit]: https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/bc/gulf/activ/camping/campinglavantpays-frontcountrycamping#SidneySpit

The most accessible campground is SMONEƒÜTEN. It's just 3 km away from Swartz Bay
and has easy access to the Lochside Cycling Trail (Swartz Bay to Downtown
Victoria). The campground is primitive (pit toilets, no electricity, **no
showers**). No campsite escapes from ferry and airplane noises during the day
and most campsites campsites are too close to the highway (**road noise**).
Panorama Recreation Center is relatively close (~8 km), offering showers for 2
CAD.

Prior Centennial is a smaller campground, not as close to an airport or harbour
so less noisy than SMONEƒÜTEN, but still pretty close to a local road and a
lodge. It's a primitive campground (pit toilets, no electricity, **no
showers**), but the lodge nearby has restaurant and looks quite fancy.

The most reserved campground is Sidney Spit. Also primitive (pit toilets, no
electricity, **no showers**), and there's **no potable water** available on the
island. It's not accessible by car so it tends to be easier to book, though it's
necessary to time the [Sidney Ferry][sidney-spit-ferry] (book round-trip!) and
**Parks Canada does not allow bikes on Sidney Spit, the ferry won't take them**.
There is no garbage bin on the island so you have to take your trash back with
you, along a 1 km walk to the ferry harbour. Despite all challenges, it's a
stunning place and the whole island can be explored.

Between Narvaez Bay and Shingle Bay, the former is more bike friendly (short
trail to get there and has bike racks) and the latter is more car accessible
(only a short walk from the parking lot). All campgrounds are primitive
(pit/compost toilets, no electricity, **no showers**) and have **no potable
water**.

# Touring Progression

### Vancouver Journey

Changelog:

- 2024-08-19: I tested the transition from Prospect Point Trail to Stanley Park
  Causeway and it's pretty alright. It's a pedestrian-heavy area but it's no
  issue to walk the bike 100 meters. It's a place that calls for a stop anyway.
  The Stanley Park Causeway itself is the problem, as the traffic coming down
  Lions Gate is very noisy. It's possible to fly down the bike lane too, but the
  big vehicles detract from the experience; cool to do once but not interested
  in repeating it. I'd like to replace this segment of the route but I don't
  know if that's possible without giving up Prospect Point and there are no
  alternative bike trails in the right side of the park.
