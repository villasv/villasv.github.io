Three frontcountry campgrounds:

SMONEƒÜTEN on Vancouver Island, Prior Centennial on Pender Island, and Sidney
Spit on Sidney Island. All of these are open May 15 to Sept 30. Backcountry
campgrounds are accessible year round but are not regularly maintained from Oct

##### [SMONEƒÜTEN][smonecten]
[smonecten]: https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/bc/gulf/activ/camping/campinglavantpays-frontcountrycamping#McDonald

The most bike-friendly campground is SMONEƒÜTEN, with access to the Lochside
Cycling Trail (from Swartz Bay to Downtown Victoria) and walk-in sites close to
entrance in pleasant wooded area, with a communal campfire ring. From Swartz Bay
to SMONEƒÜTEN via Swartz Bay Road it's about three more kms. The downside of this
campsite is being next to a highway; depending on the campsite position it's
possible to hear traffic noise.

##### Prior Centennial

##### Pender Island

#### K8: Fisgard Lighthouse

#### K9: Fort Rodd Hill 

#### K10: Pacific Rim Park Reserve

## Notes on Bikes & Transit

Nearly every bus will have two racks. Canada Line asks one bike per car, but
Millennium, Expo and West Coast Express allow two bikes per car. SeaBus has a
limit of 6 bikes during rush hours (07:00-09:30 & 15:00-18:30). The Bike Bus
accommodates 10 bikes total.
