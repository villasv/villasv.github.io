[smonecten]: https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/bc/gulf/activ/camping/campinglavantpays-frontcountrycamping#McDonald

The most bike-friendly campground is SMONEƒÜTEN, with access to the Lochside
Cycling Trail (from Swartz Bay to Downtown Victoria) and walk-in sites close to
entrance in pleasant wooded area, and a communal campfire ring. From Swartz Bay
to SMONEƒÜTEN via Swartz Bay Road it's about 3 km. The downside of this campsite
is being next to a highway; depending on the campsite position it's possible to
hear traffic noise.
