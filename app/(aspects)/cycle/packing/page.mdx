The most bike-accessible campground is SMONEƒÜTEN, with access to the Lochside
Cycling Trail (from Swartz Bay to Downtown Victoria) and walk-in sites close to
entrance in pleasant wooded area, and a communal campfire ring. The downside is
that some campsites are too close to the highway.

The most reserved campground is Sidney Spit. It offers sandy beaches, wooded
trails and an abundance of birds and marine life. It does not have potable water
available, but it's not accessible by car so it tends to be easier to book,
though it's necessary to time the [Sidney Ferry][sidney-spit-ferry].

Between Narvaez Bay and Shingle Bay, the former is more bike friendly (short
trail to get there and has bike racks) and the latter is more car accessible
(only a short walk from the parking lot).

Ferry from Tsawwassen to Mayne Island then another to Pender Island.

### Notes on Bikes & Transit

per car, but Millennium Line, Expo Line and the West Coast Express allow two
bikes per car. SeaBus has a limit of 6 bikes during rush hours (07:00-09:30 &
15:00-18:30). The Bike Bus accommodates 10 bikes total.
