### Vancouver Journey

Changelog:

- 2024-08-19: I tested the transition from Prospect Point Trail to Stanley Park
  Causeway and it's pretty alright. It's a pedestrian-heavy area but it's no
  issue to walk the bike 100 meters. It's a place that calls for a stop anyway.
  The Stanley Park Causeway itself is the problem, as the traffic coming down
  Lions Gate is very noisy. It's possible to fly down the bike lane too, but the
  big vehicles zooming past really detract from the experience; cool to do once
  but not interested in repeating it. I'd like to replace this segment of the
  route but I don't know if that's possible without giving up Prospect Point and
  there are no alternative bike trails in the right side of the park.
