# ðŸš¥ Towards Zero Traffic Deaths

In 2017, I moved from my beloved birthplace, Rio de Janeiro, to advance my
career in the powerhouse that is SÃ£o Paulo. One of the biggest improvements in
my quality of life came from going car-free. While I occasionally used a car to
visit in-laws or travel to the countryside, swapping the stress of driving and
the costs of maintaining a car for a mix of subway and bike-share cycling was a
game changer. This isn't the norm in SÃ£o Paulo, but it was a newfound privilege
that became a key factor in my enjoyment of the city.

Fast-forward a few years to 2023: the urbanist movement around 15-minute cities
was growing stronger, the climate crisis was accelerating, active transportation
policies and experiments were becoming popular, and I was moving to Vancouver.
If my overall experience as city dweller improved in almost every way after
moving to SÃ£o Paulo (except perhaps in the "beach time" axis), these gains
repeated tenfold in the "Greenest City". Plus, I got beaches back! Well, with
caveats, but I digress.

On one hand, I became more confident than ever that I can live a complete urban
life without owning a car due to the decent amount of cycling infrastructure in
and near Downtown Vancouver, a transit system punching way above its weight for
the metro region size and population (by NA/LATAM standards), and the amount of
public-transit-accessible adventures - from turquoise lake hikes to snowboarding
mountaintops.

On the other hand, progress is sometimes slow, sometimes non-existent, as waves
of car-centrism ebb and flow more or less in synchrony with conservatism
majorities on the wheels of the public sphere.


Rio, SÃ£o Paulo, and Vancouver can and should and do more to make car dependency
a thing of the past, so becoming car-free becomes not a privilege of the few,
but a feasible choice for anyone. Owning a car should be a matter of personal
preference as much as its color, not a condition for getting access to work or
leisure.

## Getting Involved

The biggest barrier to more people cycling on big cities has always been safety.
This is for good reason: in Vancouver as of 2023, about 100 people die in
traffic every year while trying to get from point A to point B. It's no wonder
people wish to have as much metal around them as possible while on the road, but
unfortunately that also creates a negative feedback loop where more/bigger SUVs
make it even less safe for everyone else - specially for those on any other less
protected transportation device: bicycles, skateboards, rollers, or just walking
on two legs.

That's where Vision Zero comes in. Conceptually, it's [a multi-national effort
to zero out traffic related fatalities, started in Sweden in 1997][vz]. It's
recognized officially as a [provincial level program in British Columbia][bc-vz]
as well as a [municipal one in Vancouver][cov-vz]. Most importantly, it's also a
program that local advocacy groups can do serious work, like the [Vision Zero
Vancouver][vzv] which aims to put some momentum towards Vision Zero for the
metro region.
