# Towards Zero Traffic Deaths

In 2017, I moved from my beloved birthplace, Rio de Janeiro, to advance my
career in the powerhouse that is São Paulo. At the time, one of the biggest
improvements in my quality of life came from going car-free. While I
occasionally used a car to visit in-laws or travel to the countryside, swapping
the stress of driving and the costs of maintaining a car for a mix of subway and
bike-share cycling was a game-changer. This isn't the norm in São Paulo, but it
was a newfound privilege that became a key factor in my enjoyment of the city.

Fast-forward a few years to 2023: the urbanist movement around 15-minute cities
was growing stronger, the climate crisis was accelerating, active transportation
policies and experiments were becoming popular, and I was moving to Canada. If
my overall experience as city dweller improved in almost every way after moving
to São Paulo (except perhaps in the "beach time" axis), these gains increased
tenfold in Vancouver. Plus, I got beaches back! Well, with caveats, but I
digress.

On one hand, I became more confident than ever that I can live a complete urban
life without owning a car due to the decent amount of cycling infrastructure in
and near Downtown Vancouver, a transit system that punches way above its weight
for the metro region's size and population (by North American standards), and
the numerous adventures accessible by a combination of cycling and transit—from
turquoise lakes to ski resorts.

On the other hand, progress is sometimes slow, sometimes non-existent, as waves
of car-centrism ebb and flow more or less in synchrony with conservatism
majorities on the wheels of the responsible public offices. People who are
heavily invested on their car-centric lifestyle will fight back against changes
in infrastructure that prioritizes other modes of transport - even though most
often reducing the number of unnecessary car trips improves traffic for those
who really need it.

Vancouver can and should do more to make car dependency a thing of the past.
Becoming car-free should not be a privilege for a few, but a feasible choice for
anyone. Owning a car should be a matter of personal preference as much as its
color. It should not be a necessary condition for getting access to employment
or leisure.

## Getting Involved

The biggest barrier to more people cycling on big cities has always been safety.
This is for good reason: in Vancouver as of 2023, about 100 people die in
traffic every year. It's no wonder people wish to have as much metal around them
as possible while on the road.

Unfortunately this incentive to one-up other road users creates a perverse
feedback loop where more/bigger SUVs dominate the streets and make it even less
safe for everyone else - specially for those on any other less protected
transportation device: bicycles, skateboards, rollers, wheelchairs or just
walking.

That's where Vision Zero comes in. Conceptually, it's [a multi-national effort
to zero out traffic related fatalities, started in Sweden in 1997][vz]. It's
recognized officially as a [provincial level program in British Columbia][bc-vz]
as well as a [municipal one in Vancouver][cov-vz]. Most importantly, it's a
program that local advocacy groups can engage in serious work, like [Vision Zero
Vancouver][vzv] which aims to put some momentum towards Vision Zero for the
metro region.
