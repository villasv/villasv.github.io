      THE PURPOSE: To see life; to see the world; to eyewitness great events; to
      watch the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud; to see strange
      things - machines, armies, multitudes, shadows in the jungle and on the
      moon; to see our work - our paintings, towers and discoveries; to see
      things thousands of miles away, things hidden behind walls and within
      rooms, things dangerous to come to: the women that men love and many
      children; to see and to take pleasure in seeing; to see and be amazed; to
      see and be instructed; Thus to see, and to be shown, is now the will and
      new expectancy of half of humankind. To see, and to show, is the mission
      now undertaken by a new kind of publication, THE SHOW-BOOK OF THE WORLD,
      hereinafter described.

    producing 1,864 consecutive weekly issues. In its prime, it would come to
    sell more than 10 million copies a week, playing a historical role in
    photojournalism. Its founder, Henry Robinson Luce, had an ambitious vision
    for a picture book magazine he described in its prospectus, reflecting on
    the purpose of human life itself.

      That ideal found its way into the 2013 movie "The Secret Life of Walter
      Mitty", which follows a daydreaming photographic assets manager from LIFE
      magazine as he ventures into the world while the magazine nears its end
      with one last print issue. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, the movie
      adaptation of the LIFE magazine emphasizes its motto:
