      THE PURPOSE: To see life; to see the world; to eyewitness great events; to
      watch the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud; to see strange
      things - machines, armies, multitudes, shadows in the jungle and on the
      moon; to see our work - our paintings, towers and discoveries; to see
      things thousands of miles away, things hidden behind walls and within
      rooms, things dangerous to come to: the women that men love and many
      children; to see and to take pleasure in seeing; to see and be amazed; to
      see and be instructed; Thus to see, and to be shown, is now the will and
      new expectancy of half of humankind. To see, and to show, is the mission
      now undertaken by a new kind of publication, THE SHOW-BOOK OF THE WORLD,
      hereinafter described.

    producing 1,864 consecutive weekly issues. In its prime it would come to
    sell more than 10 million copies a week, playing a historical role in
    photojournalism. Its founder Henry Robinson Luce had an ambitious vision for
    a picture book magazine he described in its prospectus quoted above,
    reflecting on the purpose of human life itself.

    <h2>Universe of Mitty</h2>
    <Paragraph>
      That ideal found its way into the 2013 movie "The Secret Life of Walter
      Mitty", which follows a daydreaming negative assets manager from LIFE
      magazine venturing into the world while the magazine nears its end with a
      last print issue. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, the movie
      adaptation of the LIFE magazine emphasizes its motto:

    <Paragraph>
      The movie had a real imprint on me, in a way that I never forgot the
      feelings of adventure and warmth from that quote. When I later discovered
      the original vision of the real-world iconic LIFE, I vowed to never lose
      sight of that aspiration.

      Drawing from Henry Luce's vision, LIFE's historical motif and modern
