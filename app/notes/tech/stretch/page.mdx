# Arcane & Blursed StretchText

The web is built on HyperText Markup Language (HTML), [proposed in 1990][html]
as a way to solve an inherent problem with vast bodies of writing: referencing
and creating links to other content.

[html]: https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html

The technology on HyperText has come a long way. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
was [proposed in 1994][css] bringing versatility to layout and visual aspects of
HyperText documents; and [in 1995 JavaScript came along][js] to enable dynamic
documents and complex behavior.

[js]: https://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/https://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html

It didn't take two decades before these technologies would grow nearly
limitless. Tools like [D3][] showcase how flexible the definition of what a
"document" can be, using HyperText blocks with styling and behavior to create
amazingly complex data visualization.

Yet most medium-to-long-form writing (like this one) is still mostly confined to
print media presentation and structure, except for the occasional embedded
media. This seemingly staleness is not due to a lack of creativity. The person
who coined the term "hypertext" had already proposed wild ideas [like
StretchText in 1967][stretchtext].

StretchText is an interesting and immediately enticing concept: text that can be
expanded into more details if and only if the reader has interest on it.
[It][st1] [keeps][st2] [getting][st3] [rediscovered][st4], though never making
it into wide adoption. Most people never heard of it and those who did have a
hard time recalling it being used.

Why is that? Such an intriguing and powerful idea with so little traction. There
ought to be some reason to it. After painstakingly [writing some myself][life]
and reading it many times over, I think I can extrapolate from my own experience
and the reasons why I'm probably not going to use it much more either.

## Increased effort

When using stretchtext, in theory, one doesn't have to concern themselves with
the task of reducing the overall scope to target a specific audience, as each
reader can self guide to the appropriate level of detail according to their
level of interest and expertise.

In practice, that means writing for multiple possible audiences at the same time
and planning how to weave those two (three, four...) texts into a single current
of ideas. Instead of the usual segmentation mechanisms like foot notes, separate
paragraphs, links to a separate document or a mere subordinate clause, there's
now another set of choices to be made regarding how deep that information is
hidden and how cohesive is the surrounding content with or without that segment.

If may not sound too hard, but stretching a part of a sentence into expanded
forms within the same phrase requires writing prose similar to poetry. If
stretching whole sentences to more sentences, there's an extra effort in keeping
harmony with the paragraph. This level of orchestration highly increases the
rewriting and rewording loop.

## Marginal gains

Even if a reader is already optimally served by the current level of detail,
they will expand deeper _just to be sure_. The reader cannot tell what is their
ideal level of detail until they shoot past it, as there's usually no means of
previewing the collapsed content. Worse yet, it's likely that most readers will
expand the vast majority of collapsed content simply out of curiosity or
<StretchText wrap="FOMO">FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)</StretchText> anyway.

Readers that would otherwise have read the whole text can run out of patience
for clicking and re-reading; and readers that would have benefited from the
terser form will repeatedly experience the regret of unnecessary expansions
before they learn to live with the anxiety of not knowing what's behind the
curtain.

That's probably why many modern platforms offer preview popovers on mouse hover
instead of stretchable embedded content: tooltip panes are cheap and ephemeral.
The reader doesn't feel as much pressure to read it, we're used to dismissing
popups. Popovers and footnotes provide clearly demarcated context switching and
the reader expects those to be related but self contained and optional.

# Future as Fringe Tech

It turns out that it's easier to not try to delegate the editorialization of
content to an unspecified reader persona. Given the extra cost and little
returns, the application of StretchText is probably destined to remain rare. Its
alternatives like hyperlinks and conceptual successors like hovering tooltips
will remain the preferred choices for tucking away additional content.

It also remains true that StretchText is _enticing_. It's more interactive,
exercises curiosity, it's _different_. Because it's so difficult to get it
right, when it clicks it's amazing. Used sparingly, intentionally and with a
great deal of sense of art, it will keep getting rediscovered now and then as an
exotic spice for hypertext.
