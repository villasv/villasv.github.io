# Pour-Over

## Bloom

The bloom phase, or blooming the coffee, refers to a technique that uses a small
amount of water to initiate the brew and resting it before adding more water.
Usually the amount used is 2 to 3 times the dose of coffee in grams.

The main goal of blooming is to quickly degass the coffee. The CO2 generated
during the roasting process will otherwise generate bubbles, which insulates the
coffee particles (decreasing extraction yield) and contributes to channeling
(decreasing uniformity of extraction).

The blooming phase doesn't need to target high extraction because CO2 is very
volatile. [Some professionals argue][SamoBloom] this to be an opportunity for a
cooler bloom (around 60~70 °C) to try and preserve aroma. Most people don't
bother. Chasing volatile aromatic compounds hasn't yet been shown
demonstrably fruitful.

## Swirl

An alternatives to swirling: using a spoon to stir the coffee bed;
[Wet-WDT][Wet-WDT] (or WWDT for short).

## Dialing

The process of dialing in a coffee refers to the process of refining the recipe
for a given coffee sample, usually a newly opened package.

The most straightforward approach is to pick a simple recipe and stick with it.
Simpler recipes are easier to reproduce and consistency is essential for fine
adjustments. Start with reasonable defaults: water at 95 C; 60 g/L dose; 60 s
bloom; a grind setting that puts the whole brew between 1m30s and 2m30s. The
grind setting is highly dependant on the grinder characteristics, just pick
whatever seems to work often enough.

Either start brewing with the defined defaults, or try and guess a few initial
adjustments based on roast level and coffee varietal. For darker roasts or
denser beans, one would generally want to lower extraction; the opposite for
very light roasts or stale beans.

Burnt notes? Extract less. Hollow profile? Extract more. To increase or decrease
extraction, play with temperature, dose and contact time: ± 5 C, ± 5 g/L, ± 20
s. One way to influence contact time would be to change the grind settings, but
try using agitation first.

The last resort is changing the grind setting. Most coffees are plausibly
extracted close to their optimal within the parameter variations of temperature,
dose and agitation alone. Take this opportunity to eliminate one variable (grind
size).

There's no significant benefit to shortening bloom time except expediency so
it's fine to just stick to the default. Very fresh and gassy coffees might
benefit from a longer bloom, maybe up to 2 minutes, the bubbly-ness will tell.

## Recipes

### Bloom, Pour, Swirl ~ the basic

- 15 g of coffee
- 250 g of water

1. Bloom with 40 g of water and rest until 1:00
2. Pour the remaining 210 g
3. Swirl

Total brew time should be in or about 1:30 to 2:30.

### Matt Winton's Five Pours ~ James Hoffman's Single Cup V60

A simple 5-pour recipe for medium-coarse grinds that makes use of high
agitation. Popularized by Matt Winston ([MW1][], [MW2]) and recommended for
single-cup brews by James Hoffman ([JH1][]).

- 15 g of coffee
- 250 g of water
- Medium-fine grind, aiming at a 3m total drawdown

1. Bloom with 50 g of water, swirl and rest until 1:00
2. Pour another 50 g, rest until 1:00
3. Pour another 50 g, rest until 1:20
4. Pour another 50 g, rest until 1:40
5. Pour the remaining 50 g and swirl

### Kissaten Coffee Dome - 喫茶店 コーヒードーム

An unnamed and very pretty technique traditional in Japanese coffee shops,
divulged by [Brewing Habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqQDYf8BmIA).
Sometimes called Osmotic Flow by [CAFEC](https://cafec-jp.com/brewing-guide/)'s
marketing, though the science justifying that name is controversial.

- Minimum 18 g coffee dose, fresh and darker roasts preferred
- 1:13 to 1:16 ratio, traditionally closer to 1:13
- 80-85 °C water is enough for such high dose and darker roast
- Minimize stirring by pouring very slowly and very close (about 1 cm high)
- Grind size about a bit coarser than a normal V60 grind to speed up flow

1. Bloom with 2-3 x dose in slow spirals (10-30 seconds rest)
2. Pour at the center up to 1/3 of the total brew (let it drain for 5 seconds)
3. Pour the remaining 2/3 in a slow spiral up to a ~2.5 cm diameter
4. Let it drain only for 5 seconds, then remove brewer interrupting drawdown

## Bypass

It's when water goes around the beans, instead of through. The higher the water
level relative to the coffee bed, the more bypass in a regular filter.

No-Bypass Filters
It's a concept around pour-over coffee.

Some of the water goes side-ways in the filter and around the coffee.
That water is called bypass water.

The more water goes through coffee, the more solubles down the cup.
Less bypass means more effective and efficient extraction.
A stronger extraction.

Aeropress is zero-bypass, espresso as well.
But water doesn't want to go through coffee, it takes pressure.
