# What's Up

## Life

_Updated 2025-03-17_

Vancouver is lighting up. Winter is gone and spring is creeping in with its
colors and general uplift in spirits. We arrived just in time for the cherry
blossoms and even though it looks like we could still catch a late day in the
mountain to try snowboarding one last time, we're feeling like the times are
ripe for moving on. Carnival is gone, the year is now starting for real.

We saw our parents, grandparents, siblings and nephews in Brazil. It's always so
great and so painful - such is the current music of our lives. It's a moving
tune but we're now longing for a rythm slowdown before the _crescendo_ of making
the most of Vancouver's summer. I ended up not having time nor energy to seek
out old friendships to pay a vist, in part because I was working most days of
the trip, in part because I was working on a weird timezone offset, the biggest
part straighforwardly was a lack of preparation. Maybe next time, I like to
think.

### Stuff

For music, Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish remain dominating the rotation after
their awesome concerts, but entering the mix is The Weekend.

## Projects

_Updated 2025-03-17_

This is more of a wishlist of things I'd like to be doing right now than a real
reflection of what I'm actually doing, but it all starts with an aspiration.
Writing these down also helps me to reflect: if these are the important things
to me, what's stopping me from working on them?

### Concentration and Discipline in Living

The grander [a life's purpose is imagined](/notes/words/life), the wider a chasm
is created between its idealism and the everyday experience - the endless flurry
of maintenance tasks that embodies a life of responsibilities. How to reconcile
the mundaneness of the present with the ambition of the future?

A solution for this conundrum is to embrace it as a contradiction, to overcommit
to that ideal as to make it, by definition, impossible. In vowing to summit the
insurmoutable, there's nothing else to do but to throw one feet in front of the
the other, attentive to the rocks in the way while keeping sight of the top of
the world.

To help me on this jorney, I'm working on composing a song and building a
metronome.

### Nine-to-Five Employment

I'm still working at AWS, with manageable levels of stress and off-hours work.
The biggest challenge has been the same in the past years: aligning work that is
interesting and _fun_ with work that brings impact and recognition. This got a
bit harder since I've started viying for a promotion to a Senior position, but
at the end of the day I still prioritize _doing cool stuff and doing it well_
even if a lot of it will end up invisible and delaying my career advancement.
It's an uncomfortable situation at times, but it's the best compromise I've
found in which I can taste the privilege of enjoying my craft while still
accepting the condition of having to do whatever the organization decides. At
the end of the day, it's an acceptable middle ground of having some cake and
eating it too. The one unresolved aspect is working for Amazon, and this seems
to be getting worse considering 2025's USA politics developments, but I trick
myself into not thinking about it too much - at least it's not Meta or Xitter,
and I'm not working on anything ethically dubious, it's mostly deep in the weeds
fault tolerance and availability improvements. Still, the corrosion of character
is real and I know I'm rationalizing my dealings with a devil of the golden
handcuffs.

### Federated Networks & This Website

I'm increasingly letting go of centralized social media, but I still want to be
in touch with loved ones and like-minded people, so I migrated my online
presence to the respective federated alternatives: (Xitter to [Mastodon][],
Instagram to [Pixelfed][], Goodreads to [NeoDB][]). Being realistic though, I
know that the vast majority of the people in my life will not follow me there,
so I'm also looking into broadcasting my activity in more ways than federation.

[NeoDB]: http://neodb.social/users/villasv/

I've owned my domain and this website since 2019, but it never really took off
because social media has been a much easier path to interact with people. This
transition cost has decreased recently, so I'm ready to renew these efforts.
This website is going to be the basis for the RSS feed and possibly a
newsletter, so I'm back to shaping it up. This page is a big part of that.

In January 2025 I was able to get my Mastodon, Pixelfed and NeoDB activity
merged into a single [RSS feed](/feed.xml) (used to generate the [updates on my
home page](/)). This was [much easier than I thought][generate-rss] and renewed
my belief in the power of these open platforms.

Next steps: 1) Consolidate my writing on [this project's notes][indieweb] about
the fediverse and RSS 2) Investigate how to deliver newsletters with a curated
selection of my updates; 3) Automate a new type of activity: additions or
changes to my written material - like this page;
