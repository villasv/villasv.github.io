# What's Up

_Updated 2025-02-12_

## Life

Vancouver is cold. Most days feel like below freezing and snow is still around,
so I have been riding my bike less and using public transit more. Either method
takes me on average less than 15 minutes to get to work, making my mandated
Return To Office 5 days a week (aka RTO5) much more bearable than it would be
otherwise so I'm grateful for this fortune and privilege.

Riding my bike hasn't been bad, actually. I did it on the day that had peak snow
conditions and I had a blast even though the bike paths had not been cleared
completely yet. It was one of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen, riding
along a fresh-powdered and deserted seawall. The biggest negative nudging me
towards the bus is my lack of preparation: I need mittens. The gloves I've been
using are not wind-proof enough. I even use them for snowboarding, but cycling
is surprisingly more demanding due to the wind.

Speaking of snowboarding... wow I just love it. I love winter now. I went 7
times so far this season (1 Whistler, 3 Cypress, 3 Grouse) - much more than I
imagined. It's an expensive hobby, and the learning curve is steep, but every
day on the mountain brings me a feeling beyond words.

## Projects

This is more of a wishlist of things I'd like to be doing right now than a real
reflection of what I'm actually doing, but it all starts with an aspiration.
Writing these down also helps me to reflect: if these are the important things
to me, what's stopping me from working on them?

1. **SECRET**: (for now, I need to coalesce my thoughts on what this means)
2. **Website**: I'm increasingly letting go of social media, but I still want to
   see and be seen by loved ones and like-minded people. Taking a step towards
   doing so a bit more on my terms, I'm advancing how much my website represents
   my interests. In January I was able to get my Mastodon, Pixelfed and NeoDB
   activity syndicated ([what?][PESOS]). Next steps: 1) Consolidate my writing
   on the [Independent Web][indieweb] about what and why I'm doing here
   regarding syndication and this ["now" page][now]; 2) Investigate how can I
   support newsletter delivery of a curated selection of my updates; 3) Automate
   a new type of update: additions and changes to my my written material - like
   this page.
