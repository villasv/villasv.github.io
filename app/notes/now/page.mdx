# What's Up

## Life

_Updated 2025-06-26_

It's officially summer, even though the weather hasn't been any better than
spring. First camping trip went well even with a bit of rain, and finally got to
camp & surf in Tofino. Also took the Hullo ferry for the first time, which was
pretty awesome. It's a bit pricey, but it's _fast_ and the experience of
watching the Stanley Park and Vancouver skyline approaching from the water as we
come back from Nanaimo... heavenly stuff. One of those moments that I think
about the privilege I have. Watching my building show up as we approach the
city, then leisurely walk to it from the ferry terminal. Indescribable feeling.

For music, Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish remain dominating the rotation after
their awesome concerts, but entering the mix is The Weekend.

## Projects

_Updated 2025-03-17_

This is more of a wishlist of things I'd like to be doing right now than a real
reflection of what I'm actually doing, but it all starts with an aspiration.
Writing these down also helps me to reflect: if these are the important things
to me, what's stopping me from working on them?

### Concentration and Discipline in Living

The grander [a life's purpose is imagined](/notes/journey/life), the wider a gap
is created between its idealism and the everyday experience - the endless flurry
of maintenance tasks that embodies a life of responsibilities. How to reconcile
the mundaneness with the aspirational?

To embrace this contradiction, overcommitting to a laborious journey that is by
definition impossible to complete. In vowing to summit the insurmoutable,
there's nothing else to do but to throw one feet in front of the the other. To
succeed is to stay moving.

### The Outdoors: Cycling, Running, Hiking, Camping, Snowboarding, Surfing

### Nine-to-Five Employment

I'm still working at AWS, with manageable levels of stress and off-hours work.
The biggest challenge has been the same in the past years: aligning work that is
interesting and _fun_ with work that brings impact and recognition. I still
prioritize _doing cool stuff and doing it well_ even if a lot of it will end up
invisible and delaying my career advancement. It's an uncomfortable situation at
times, but it's the best compromise I've found in which I can taste the
privilege of enjoying my craft. I'm having some cake and eating it too. The one
unresolved aspect is working for Amazon, and this seems to be getting worse
considering the latest USA political developments, but I trick myself into not
thinking about it too much - at least it's not Meta or Xitter, and I'm not
working on anything ethically dubious, it's mostly deep in the weeds fault
tolerance and availability improvements. Though I am a cog in the machine, and
in theory I can afford to leave. For now I'll hang on because there are other
facets of life that could use the paycheck and stability.

### Federated Networks & This Website

I've owned my domain and this website since 2019, but it never really took off
because social media has been a much easier path to interact with people. This
transition cost has decreased recently, so I'm ready to renew these efforts.
This website is going to be the basis for the RSS feed and possibly a
newsletter, so I'm back to shaping it up. This page is a big part of that.

I'm increasingly letting go of centralized social media, but I still want to be
in touch with loved ones and like-minded people, so I migrated my online
presence to the respective federated alternatives: (Xitter to [Mastodon][],
Goodreads to [NeoDB][]). Being realistic though, I know that the vast majority
of the people in my life will not install a new app to follow me, so I'm also
looking into broadcasting my activity in more ways than federation.

[NeoDB]: http://neodb.social/users/villasv/

I'm kind of giving up on Pixelfed for now. I'm thankfull that this project
exists, but I still can't just whip up my phone and share an ephemeral "story"
with it, the UX is not there.

In January 2025 I was able to get my Mastodon, Pixelfed and NeoDB activity
merged into a single [RSS feed](/feed.xml) (used to generate the [my home page
updates](/)). This was [much easier than I thought][generate-rss] and renewed my
belief in the power of these open platforms.

Next steps: 1) Consolidate my writing on [this project's notes][indieweb] about
the fediverse and RSS 2) Investigate how to deliver newsletters with a curated
selection of my updates; 3) Automate a new type of activity: additions or
changes to my written material - like this page;
