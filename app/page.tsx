          This is my humble abode on the Worldwide Web. It is statically
          generated from some markdown documents, custom frontend components and
          a flat-file database. You can check it out on{" "}
          <GitHub repo="villasv.github.io" />. If none of that made sense, no
          worries. I just like my website and wanted to tell you about it. Maybe
          this encourages you to make your own as well?
